"Dear John, Dear Coltrane by Michael S. Harper",Michael S. Harper,"'Dear John, Dear Coltrane' by Michael S. Harper is a powerful poem that speaks to the importance of John Coltrane's music. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by alluding to an act of violence perpetrated on a Black man in the American south. He immediately describes Coltrane growing up in the same area and leaving for Philadelphia to play music. As the poem progresses, the speaker introduces the reader to Coltrane's creative expression, his struggle with drugs and alcohol, and later, the liver disease that resulted.","a love supreme, a love supreme
a love supreme, a love supreme

Sex fingers toes
in the marketplace
near your father's church
in Hamlet, North Carolina—
witness to this love
in this calm fallow
of these minds,
there is no substitute for pain:
genitals gone or going,
seed burned out,
you tuck the roots in the earth,
turn back, and move
by river through the swamps,
singing: a love supreme, a love supreme;
what does it all mean?
Loss, so great each black
woman expects your failure
in mute change, the seed gone.
You plod up into the electric city—
your song now crystal and
the blues. You pick up the horn
with some will and blow
into the freezing night:
a love supreme, a love supreme—

Dawn comes and you cook
up the thick sin 'tween
impotence and death, fuel
the tenor sax cannibal
heart, genitals, and sweat
that makes you clean—
a love supreme, a love supreme—

Why you so black?
cause I am
why you so funky?
cause I am
why you so black?
cause I am
why you so sweet?
cause I am
why you so black?
cause I am
a love supreme, a love supreme:

So sick
you couldn't play Naima,
so flat we ached
for song you'd concealed
with your own blood,
your diseased liver gave
out its purity,
the inflated heart
pumps out, the tenor kiss,
tenor love:
a love supreme, a love supreme—
a love supreme, a love supreme—",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42827/dear-john-dear-coltrane
Parrot by Stevie Smith,Stevie Smith,"‘Parrot‘ depicts the declining health of a wondrously beautiful bird in north London, where it appears to have been taken against its will. The poem begins by describing the unwell bird and its view over the houses near Noel Park in north London. The creature’s ill health is emphasized as early as the poem’s opening line. As the poem continues, Smith creates a sense of dislocation by contrasting the bird’s current surroundings with the tropical environment it came from. In the final stanza, the parrot appears close to death, and Smith appears to hope for its swift arrival so that the bird may be free from its suffering.","The old sick green parrot
High in a dingy cage
Sick with malevolent rage
Beadily glutted his furious eye
On the old dark
Chimneys of Noel Park
Far from his jungle green
Over the seas he came
To the yellow skies, to the dripping rain,
To the night of his despair.
And the pavements of his street
Are shining beneath the lamp
With a beauty that’s not for one
Born under a tropic sun.
He has croup. His feathered chest
Knows no minute of rest.
High on his perch he sits
And coughs and spits,
Waiting for death to come.
Pray heaven it won’t be long.",https://revise.wales/pastPapers/A-level/EnglishLit/unit3/s17-2727-01.pdf
Dust of Snow by Robert Frost,Robert Frost,"The simplicity, in the end, is the key element of the work as nature is shown as magnificent enough to bring a person into a pleasant mentality. It grounds the narrator in a satisfying place, like a “tree,” and this uncomplicated action is mirrored in the uncomplicated wording, techniques, and structure of ‘Dust of Snow.’ Together, these elements solidify the theme of ‘Dust of Snow’: that nature and simplicity, if appreciated and looked into, can be grounding factors in a time of stress.","The way a crow
Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree

Has given my heart
A change of mood
And saved some part
Of a day I had rued.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44262/dust-of-snow
Suburban Sonnet by Gwen Harwood,Gwen Harwood,"'Suburban Sonnet' by Gwen Harwood is a poem about the difficulties of motherhood and the mental and emotional struggles of a housewife. In the first lines of 'Suburban Sonnet,' the speaker describes a housewife who spends her time practicing a fugue, a specific type of musical composition. She knows that it doesn't matter to anyone whether or not she plays well, but she continues to. There are two children in the room, screaming at one another. This forces her to stop playing until she can quiet them down. Suddenly, another one of her duties as a housewife calls: a pot on the stove is boiling over. She suddenly feels completely overwhelmed, sick, and in pain. The poet compares the woman's happiness to the soap running down the drain. This leads to another personal music-related image. Her children are looking at a dead mouse in a trap, feeling scared despite it being dead. She disposes of the creature with an article featuring bread recipes.","She practises a fugue, though it can matter
to no one now if she plays well or not.
Beside her on the floor two children chatter,
then scream and fight. She hushes them. A pot
boils over. As she rushes to the stove
too late, a wave of nausea overpowers
subject and counter-subject. Zest and love
drain out with soapy water as she scours
the crusted milk. Her veins ache. Once she played
for Rubinstein, who yawned. The children caper
round a sprung mousetrap where a mouse lies dead.
When the soft corpse won't move they seem afraid.
She comforts them; and wraps it in a paper
featuring: Tasty dishes from stale bread.",https://genius.com/Gwen-harwood-suburban-sonnet-annotated
Unending Love by Rabindranath Tagore,Rabindranath Tagore,"'Unending Love' by Rabindranath Tagore is a heartfelt poem about a speaker's devotional love for his beloved (the creator or his lady love). Tagore's poetic persona describes how his love merges with all the loves, past and forever. This piece of Rabindranath Tagore is another song in which, it seems, he speaks of his love for the creator. It can also be true that this poem can be written for a lady whom the speaker loves the most. His words reflect his deeper emotions and the devotional aspect of love between two souls. Tagore's persona gifts her with a “necklace of songs” which she wears in pride. He compares her to the polestar that pierces all the darkness of pessimism and enlightens him. Their love is old, yet it renews forever. In her, she has found universality and their memories of togetherness will last forever.","I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
In life after life, in age after age, forever.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered forever.

You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
At the heart of time, love of one for another.
We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever.",https://allpoetry.com/Unending-Love
Crocus by Alfred Kreymborg,Alfred Kreymborg,"'Crocus' by Alfred Kreymborg describes the vast darkness of winter and the immensely powerful “spark” which leads the world into spring. The poem begins with the speaker stating that now is the time in which spring and summer are so far in the past that the trees have forgotten they ever had left. The narrator is overwhelmed by the dark cold of the season and wants to know whose fault it is that the world is the way it is. He continues on to speak about the eventual “spark” that will come and set the Earth turning once more. It will set spring in motion, lead the crocuses to bloom, and overflow the rivers with water.","When trees have lost remembrance of the leaves
that spring bequeaths to summer, autumn weaves
and loosens mournfully—this dirge, to whom
does it belong—who treads the hidden loom?

When peaks are overwhelmed with snow and ice,
and clouds with crepe bedeck and shroud the skies—
nor any sun or moon or star, it seems,
can wedge a path of light through such black dreams—

All motion cold, and dead all traces thereof:
What sudden shock below, or spark above,
starts torrents raging down till rivers surge—
that aid the first small crocus to emerge?

The earth will turn and spin and fairly soar,
that couldn't move a tortoise-foot before—
and planets permeate the atmosphere
till misery depart and mystery clear!—

And yet, so insignificant a hearse?—
who gave it the endurance so to brave
such elements?—shove winter down a grave?—
and then lead on again the universe?",https://poets.org/poem/crocus
Lonely Hearts by Wendy Cope,Wendy Cope,"'Lonely Hearts' by Wendy Cope is an ironic poem that reveals how a speaker is desperately searching for a life partner in a newspaper column. This poem begins with a speaker asking others whether they can find her a perfect partner. Her simple wish deals with only finding a partner with whom she can start a relationship. The speaker is middle-aged and has a son. She is inexperienced, cold, and fascinated by a new beginning. Her partner can be a biker or a gay vegetarian with few friends. She is also a lonely soul and takes interest in music and Shakespeare's poetry. The partner can be an executive who is searching for a bisexual woman with arty looks. Whatsoever, all she wants is a partner who resides in North London.","Can someone make my simple wish come true?
Male biker seeks female for touring fun.
Do you live in North London? Is it you?
Gay vegetarian whose friends are few,
I'm into music, Shakespeare and the sun.
Can someone make my simple wish come true?
Executive in search of something new—
Perhaps bisexual woman, arty, young.
Do you live in North London? Is it you?
Successful, straight and solvent? I am too—
Attractive Jewish lady with a son.
Can someone make my simple wish come true?
I'm Libran, inexperienced and blue—
Need slim, non-smoker, under twenty-one.
Do you live in North London? Is it you?
Please write (with photo) to Box 152.
Who knows where it may lead once we've begun?

Northern Pike by James Wright,James Wright,"'Northern Pike' by James Wright is a peaceful poem about a fishing trip and a speaker's appreciation for nature and life. The poem describes the images he saw on a fishing trip and his experience with the fish itself. He notes the beautiful, life-affirming sights and sounds in his vicinity and how killing and eating the fish made him feel. The poem ends on an optimistic note, suggesting that happiness can be found through simple pleasures in the natural world.","All right. Try this,
Then. Every body
I know and care for,
And every body
Else is going
To die in a loneliness
I can't imagine and a pain
I don't know. We had
To go on living. We
Untangled the net, we slit
The body of this fish
Open from the hinge of the tail
To a place beneath the chin
I wish I could sing of.
I would just as soon we let
The living go on living.
An old poet whom we believe in
Said the same thing, and so
We paused among the dark cattails and prayed
For the muskrats,
For the ripples below their tails,
For the little movements that we knew the crawdads were making

under water,
For the right-hand wrist of my cousin who is a policeman.
We prayed for the game warden's blindness.
We prayed for the road home.
We ate the fish.
There must be something very beautiful in my body,
I am so happy.",https://poets.org/poem/northern-pike
Elegy for Bruce Lee by W. Todd Kaneko,W. Todd Kaneko,"'Elegy for Bruce Lee' by W. Todd Kaneko begins with the measured 'one-two, ch cha chá' that echoes as a beat throughout the poem. The rhythm is reflecting the steady pace of throwing punches, Kaneko reflecting Bruce Lee's fighting practice. Kaneko discusses his father in relation to Bruce Lee, using him as an example of how to fight, but also how to live life. When Kaneko's father dies, he remembers the feeling of grief, expressing it through the practice of fighting. The final lines reflect on this fusion of grief and fighting, drawing the two images together in a somber combination.","Somewhere in the dark sky is a beautiful fight,
one-two, cha cha chá—all our knuckles rapping

against the stars’ edges for the dancing master,
for a flying sidekick to our bodies’ centers.

My father called you Little Dragon Lee, told me
how you swiveled your hips across the floor—

three-four, cha cha chá—then you both wrote
love poems for a girl in your English class.

I practiced throwing roundhouse kicks as a boy,
feet aimed at my reflection in store windows,

at street signs, at parked cars, everything I knew
I could break. Now, my feet cannot leave

the ground, and I write love poems for the dead.
The last time I watched Enter the Dragon,

I imagined it was my father emerging victorious
from the hall of mirrors, my father hustling

on the dance floor, because the last time
I saw my father, he had been waiting for me

the whole day in the morgue. Hold me,
he said, and I did until his body stopped

acting like it was alive. There is no fight
where there is no spark, no wretched cock crow

in the dark, just this cha cha chá—grief is a fist
and a promise to hurt someone. Just give it

an inch between knuckle and breastbone.
It will punch through everyone.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/153505/elegy-for-bruce-lee
Babies by Alice Fulton,Alice Fulton,"'Babies' by Alice Fulton is a powerful poem filled with images that describe what it's like to age from childhood into adulthood. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes what a child is like when they're born. They are lulled by their mother's soothing voice into thinking that everything is going to be all right. Life feels simple when one is young. But, as a child ages, they learn that not all lies or mistakes can be erased. The poet uses an example of a scorned lover, called by the wrong name while in bed, whose affections cannot be regained. One simple mistake can ruin someone's chances at happiness. The poem concludes with a very effective image comparing life, or at least some parts of it, to a parachuter jumping out of a plane. One has a single chance to get things right.","born gorgeous with nerves, with brains
the pink of silver polish or
jellyfish wafting ornately
through the body below.
An invertebrate cooing
on the mother
tongue shushes and lulls them into thinking
all is well. As they grow they learn

salvage: tear-out
guides to happiness say apologies can outshine
lies, guilt be lickspittled from their lives, bad
glycerined to good. Like a child’s first school pencils
in their formal brilliance
and sharp new smells, they lie

as lovers. Maybe one cries
the wrong name and the night skinning
them pleasantly alive
leaps away in shards.
Then it’s time for restitution:
a tin of homebaked,
holding gingham safety, fetal
as the light through mason jars of beets and brine,
or jewelry, clasping and unclasping
aisles of fluorescence from great department stores,
a distracting plenitude, and tempting.

Still, the beloved may stay bitter as an ear
the tongue pressed
into, unwanted.
And the word end: spiney, finally-formed,
indents them and is
understood. They learn

the hard way as hurts
accrue, and the brain is cratered as a rock
by rain that fell ages past
on unprotected mud. An insult keeps
despite apologies. When it vaporizes at last,
its space fills with grains that harden
to a fossil shaped exactly
like the insult.
They grow up when they know that

sometimes
only a gesture responsive as a heart-
shaped parachute above a jump
a life depends on
to be perfect
the first time will ever do",https://poetrying.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/babies-alice-fulton/
Riposte by William Carlos Williams,William Carlos Williams,"Riposte' by William Carlos Williams is a short poem about the power of love and how impossible it is to sustain or control it. In the lines of 'Riposte,' the speaker addresses “townspeople,” a group he refers to as “my townspeople.” He's giving these men and women a lesson in love. He tells them that it is the same as water, air, and poetry. Meaning, it clears the air of poisonous gasses and makes life all-around easier to live. Through the poem, the poet also alludes to humanity's inability to capture and control love, just as they can't control the Atlantic ocean, air, or poetry.","Love is like water or the air
my townspeople;
it cleanses, and dissipates evil gases.
It is like poetry too
and for the same reasons.
Love is so precious
my townspeople
that if I were you I would
have it under lock and key—
like the air or the Atlantic or
like poetry",https://americanliterature.com/author/william-carlos-williams/poem/riposte
The Jaguar by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"The Jaguar' by Ted Hughes is a powerful poem that describes a zoo, its sorrowful inhabitants, and the one creature that hasn't given into despair. In the first two stanzas of 'The Jaguar,' Hughes speaker describes a few of the many depressed animals that make up a zoo. They include parrots shrieking for food, apes, and lethargic lions and tigers. He also makes sure, within these lines, to emphasize how “un-wild” these animals are, suggesting that something more, besides their freedom, has been taken from them. In the middle of the poem, he brings in a young child visiting the zoo and uses him to draw the poem towards the jaguar, the centerpiece of the zoo. The cat appears to be, by the speaker's account, the only animal that has a depressed representative of its species. Its power is on full display as the speaker alludes to the wildness that still resides within the cat's eyes and heart.","The apes yawn and adore their fleas in the sun.
The parrots shriek as if they were on fire, or strut
Like cheap tarts to attract the stroller with the nut.
Fatigued with indolence, tiger and lion

Lie still as the sun. The boa-constrictor’s coil
Is a fossil. Cage after cage seems empty, or
Stinks of sleepers from the breathing straw.
It might be painted on a nursery wall.

But who runs like the rest past these arrives
At a cage where the crowd stands, stares, mesmerized,
As a child at a dream, at a jaguar hurrying enraged
Through prison darkness after the drills of his eyes
On a short fierce fuse. Not in boredom—
The eye satisfied to be blind in fire,
By the bang of blood in the brain deaf the ear—
He spins from the bars, but there’s no cage to him

More than to the visionary his cell:
His stride is wildernesses of freedom:
The world rolls under the long thrust of his heel.
Over the cage floor the horizons come.",https://genius.com/Ted-hughes-the-jaguar-annotated
Jumbo Jet by Spike Milligan,Spike Milligan,"'Jumbo Jet' by Spike Milligan tells the story of an elephant that is in London and trying to make its way back to Africa. In the first lines of this piece, the speaker begins by telling the reader how he went outside one day and found an elephant in his garden. He was shocked to see him there and told him immediately that he shouldn't be there. The elephant was confused but eventually realized how lost he is. In the next lines, the elephant asks for the speaker's help getting back to Africa and the plains on which he should be roaming. The poem concludes with the speaker describing how the elephant got lost after getting to the Thames Embankment. He was then caught by police, tied up outside to a lamppost, and then become lost once more when he wandered off during the early morning hours. In the final couplet the speaker, in an upbeat tone, assures the reader that if they see an elephant on a “Jumbo Jet” plane that he is simply trying to get home to Africa.","I saw a little elephant standing in my garden,
I said 'You don't belong in here', he said 'I beg your pardon?',
I said 'This place is England, what are you doing here?',
He said 'Ah, then I must be lost' and then 'Oh dear, oh dear'.

'I should be back in Africa, on Saranghetti's Plain',
'Pray, where is the nearest station where I can catch a train?'.
He caught the bus to Finchley and then to Mincing lane,
And over the Embankment, where he got lost, again.

The police they put him in a cell, but it was far too small,
So they tied him to a lampost and he slept against the wall.
But as the policemen lay sleeping by the twinkling light of dawn,
The lampost and the wall were there, but the elephant was gone!

So if you see an elephant, in a Jumbo Jet,
You can be sure that Africa's the place he's trying to get!",https://allpoetry.com/Jumbo-Jet
The Spanish Needle by Claude McKay,Claude McKay,"'The Spanish Needle' by Claude McKay is a beautiful, nostalgic poem that looks back on a speaker's childhood. In the stanzas, the speaker asks the Spanish needle, a type of plant, if it remembers him during his youth. He has fond memories of spending time outside, near a river, carrying water, and spending time with his love. It's clear he's feeling nostalgic about his past and hoping that through the plant, a tiny bit of himself still exists in the past.","Lovely dainty Spanish needle
With your yellow flower and white,
Dew bedecked and softly sleeping,
Do you think of me to-night?
Shadowed by the spreading mango,
Nodding o'er the rippling stream,
Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,
Do you of the exile dream?
Do you see me by the brook's side
Catching crayfish 'neath the stone,
As you did the day you whispered:
Leave the harmless dears alone?
Do you see me in the meadow
Coming from the woodland spring
With a bamboo on my shoulder
And a pail slung from a string?
Do you see me all expectant
Lying in an orange grove,
While the swee-swees sing above me,
Waiting for my elf-eyed love?
Lovely dainty Spanish needle,
Source to me of sweet delight,
In your far-off sunny southland
Do you dream of me to-night?",https://poets.org/poem/spanish-needle
The Flurry by Sharon Olds,Sharon Olds,"The Flurry' by Sharon Olds focuses on a couple planning how they will tell their children of their divorce. The poem explores the end of love, relationships coming to an end, and how that can impact people. Olds moves through many emotions in the poem, beginning with worry and ending with anger. The poem is melancholic, Olds not quite knowing how to deal with the conversation. The poet's partner is pragmatic, planning their future conversation with careful certainty. The final section of the poem focuses on Olds' emotions, her sadness transforming into anger. This anger is the only thing Olds has left now, focusing on that to try and drown out the pain of falling out of love. She has to adapt to the situation as it is, surprised by things that have changed between them.","When we talk about when to tell the kids,
we are so together, so concentrated.
I mutter, “I feel like a killer.” “I’m
the killer”—taking my wrist—he says,
holding it. He is sitting on the couch,
the old indigo chintz around him,
rich as a night sea with jellies,
I am sitting on the floor. I look up at him,
as if within some chamber of matedness,
some dust I carry around me. Tonight,
to breathe its Magellanic field is less
painful, maybe because he is drinking
a wine grown where I was born—fog,
eucalyptus, sempervirens—and I’m
sharing the glass with him. “Don’t catch
my cold,” he says, “—oh that’s right, you want
to catch my cold.” I should not have told him that,
I tell him I will try to fall out of
love with him, but I feel I will love him
all my life. He says he loves me
as the mother of our children, and new troupes
of tears mount to the acrobat platforms
of my ducts and do their burning leaps.
Some of them jump straight sideways, and, for a
moment, I imagine a flurry
of tears like a whirra of knives thrown
at a figure, to outline it—a heart’s spurt
of rage. It glitters, in my vision, I nod
to it, it is my hope.",poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/54907/the-flurry
Pride by Jackie Kay,Jackie Kay,"'Pride' by Jackie Kay is about having pride in one's identity and a woman's extraordinary meeting with a man on a night train. In the first part of the poem, the speaker begins by describing herself on a train during a nighttime journey leaving Euston station. She meets a black man on the train with whom she has an instant connection. She feels as though he can see into her mind and her past. To an extent, this proves to be true. They speak, and he explains that she is Ibo or that she comes from a specific tribe in Africa. This is highly relevant to the speaker, who is on a journey of self-discovery. They converse further, and he makes her feel as though her identity is something to be incredibly proud of. When the poem concludes, it becomes clear that the speaker has imagined this entire interaction.","When I looked up, the black man was there,
staring into my face,
as if he had always been there,
as if he and I went a long way back.
He looked into the dark pool of my eyes
as the train slid out of Euston.
For a long time this went on
the stranger and I looking at each other,
a look that was like something being given
from one to the other.
My whole childhood, l'm quite sure,
passed before him, the worst things
I've ever done, the biggest lies I've ever told.
And he was a little boy on a red dust road.
He stared into the dark depth of me,
and then he spoke:
'lbo
,' he said. 'lbo, definitely.'
Our train rushed through the dark.
'You are an Ibo!' he said, thumping the table.
My coffee jumped and spilled.
Several sleeping people woke.
The night train boasted and whistled
through the English countryside,
past unwritten stops in the blackness.
'That nose is an Ibo nose.
Those teeth are Ibo teeth,' the stranger said,
his voice getting louder and louder.
l had no doubt, from the way he said it,
that Ibo noses are the best noses in the world,
that lbo teeth are perfect pearls.
People were walking down the trembling aisle
to come and look
as the night rain babbled against the window.
There was a moment when
my whole face changed into a map,
and the stranger on the train
located even, the name
of my village in Nigeria
in the lower part of my jaw.
I told him what I'd heard was my father's name.
Okafor. He told me what it meant,
something stunning,
something so apt and astonishing.
Tell me, I asked the black man on the train
who was himself transforming,
at roughly the same speed as the train,
and could have been
at any stop, my brother, my father as a young man,
or any member of my large clan,
Tell me about the lbos.
His face had a look
I've seen on a MacLachlan, a MacDonell, a MacLeod,
the most startling thing, pride,
a quality of being certain.
'Now that I know you are an Ibo, we will eat.'
He produced a spicy meat patty,
ripping it into two.
Tell me about the lbos.
'The lbos are small in stature
Not tall like the Yoruba or Hausa.
The lbos are clever, reliable,
dependable, faithful, true.
The Ibos should be running Nigeria.
There would be none of this corruption.'
And what, I asked, are the lbos faults?
I smiled my newly acquired lbo smile,
flashed my gleaming lbo teeth.
The train grabbed at a bend,
'Faults? No faults. Not a single one.'
'If you went back,' he said brightening,
'The whole village would come out for you.
Massive celebrations. Definitely.
Definitely,' he opened his arms wide.
'The eldest grandchild- fantastic welcome.
If the grandparents are alive.'
I saw myself arriving
the hot dust, the red road,
the trees heavy with other fruits,
the bright things, the flowers.
I saw myself watching
Jackie Kay
Lucozade, The Shoes of Dead Comrades, Pride
the old people dance towards me
dressed up for me in happy prints.
And I found my feet.
I started to dance.
I danced a dance I never knew I knew.
Words and sounds fell out of my mouth like seeds.
I astonished myself.
My grandmother was like me exactly, only darker.
When I looked up, the black man had gone.
Only my own face startled me in the dark train window.",https://ro.uow.edu.au/kunapipi/vol21/iss1/9/
Aunt Helen by T.S. Eliot,T.S. Eliot,"Aunt Helen' by T.S. Eliot takes a look into the life of a recently deceased woman who appears to have been unloved while she was alive. The poem details the aftermath of this woman's death. Eliot's speaker discusses the silence on the street and alludes to the lack of mourners around the woman. Despite being her nephew, the speaker does not show any emotion. He is not grieving for her in this elegy, he is simply noting the facts of her death. The strongest emotion in the poem comes at the end when the speaker mentions the housemaid flirting with the footman.","Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,
And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
Cared for by servants to the number of four.
Now when she died there was silence in heaven
And silence at her end of the street.
The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet—
He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.
The dogs were handsomely provided for,
But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.
The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,
And the footman sat upon the dining-table
Holding the second housemaid on his knees—
Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.",poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13224/aunt-helen
The Art of Drowning by Billy Collins,Billy Collins,"'The Art of Drowning' by Billy Collins speaks humorously on near-death experiences and the idea that one's life could be contained in a “flash”. The poem begins with the speaker asking why and how the idea of life flashing before one's eyes came into being. He is mystified by it and encourages the reader to consider the same question. As the poem progresses he discusses how inadequate and distressing this experience would be. He also proposes a number of alternatives, such as a photo album being turned slowly or an essay. 'The Art of Drowning' ends with the speaker discusses one death by drowning and how one's memories would quickly be forgotten. They'd remain at the surface as one's body drifted to the bottom of a lake.","I wonder how it all got started, this business
about seeing your life flash before your eyes
while you drown, as if panic, or the act of submergence,
could startle time into such compression, crushing
decades in the vice of your desperate, final seconds.

After falling off a steamship or being swept away
in a rush of floodwaters, wouldn't you hope
for a more leisurely review, an invisible hand
turning the pages of an album of photographs-
you up on a pony or blowing out candles in a conic hat.

How about a short animated film, a slide presentation?
Your life expressed in an essay, or in one model photograph?
Wouldn't any form be better than this sudden flash?
Your whole existence going off in your face
in an eyebrow-singeing explosion of biography-
nothing like the three large volumes you envisioned.

Survivors would have us believe in a brilliance
here, some bolt of truth forking across the water,
an ultimate Light before all the lights go out,
dawning on you with all its megalithic tonnage.
But if something does flash before your eyes
as you go under, it will probably be a fish,

a quick blur of curved silver darting away,
having nothing to do with your life or your death.
The tide will take you, or the lake will accept it all
as you sink toward the weedy disarray of the bottom,
leaving behind what you have already forgotten,
the surface, now overrun with the high travel of clouds.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-art-of-drowning/
Childhood by Frances Cornford,Frances Cornford,"'Childhood' is a moving encounter between a child and an elderly figure, in which the universality of age and mortality become apparent to the child. The poem begins from a point of scepticism on behalf of the narrator who is a small child. They do not believe the cosmetic reminders of age on people they encounter to be anything more than deliberate choices, like the clothes they wear. It is only after they witness an elderly person in distress that they begin to realise that age is something genuinely debilitating and they can no longer return to their earlier ignorance of it.","I used to think that grown-up people chose
To have stiff backs and wrinkles round their nose,
And veins like small fat snakes on either hand,
On purpose to be grand.
Till through the banisters I watched one day
My great-aunt Etty’s friend who was going away,
And how her onyx beads had come unstrung.
I saw her grope to find them as they rolled;
And then I knew that she was helplessly old,
As I was helplessly young.",https://rainydaypoems.com/poems-for-kids/grandparent-poems/childhood-by-frances-cornford/
Christ of Everywhere by Henry Van Dyke,Henry van Dyke,"'Christ of Everywhere' by Henry Van Dyke is a thoughtful poem about the presence of Christ in all things that human beings do. In the first line of the poem, the speaker begins by describing how Christ is everywhere and can be found in all the faults and good deeds of human beings. Christ is there as human beings sin and strive to be better again. The final lines are addressed to Christ himself and implore him to continue guiding human beings down a righteous path, one that follows Christ's teachings.","""Christ of the Andes,"" Christ of Everywhere,
Great lover of the hills, the open air,
And patient lover of impatient men
Who blindly strive and sin and strive again, —
Thou Living Word, larger than any creed,
Thou Love Divine, uttered in human deed, —
Oh, teach the world, warring and wandering still,
Thy way of Peace, the foot path of Good Will!",https://allpoetry.com/Christ-of-Everywhere
Song For The Last Act by Louise Bogan,Louise Bogan,"Song for the Last Act' by Louise Bogan describes the complicated and emotionally confining relationship that exists between a speaker and their listener. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she knows her partner so well, their face is memorized on her heart. She will go on to say the same about their heart and voice. She has spent a great deal of time with this person, so much so she has neglected the rest of the world. 'Song for the Last Act' works as a mental and emotional stopping point for the speaker in this relationship. She is finally looking beyond her partner to everything fading and changing. The season of summer, a pattern of music, and a ship's voyage all mark the end of something. The speaker does not give a clear description of whether or not this is a happy or sad ending. One can infer from the description of the anchor in the final stanza and the descriptions of fading warmth and music that the change is painful.","Now that I have your face by heart, I look Less at its features than its darkening frame Where quince and melon, yellow as young flame, Lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd’s crook. Beyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease
The lead and marble figures watch the show Of yet another summer loath to go
Although the scythes hang in the apple trees.
Now that I have your face by heart, I look.
Now that I have your voice by heart, I read In the black chords upon a dulling page Music that is not meant for music’s cage,
Whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed. The staves are shuttled over with a stark Unprinted silence. In a double dream I must spell out the storm, the running stream. The beat’s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.
Now that I have your voice by heart, I read.
Now that I have your heart by heart, I see
The wharves with their great ships and architraves; The rigging and the cargo and the slaves
On a strange beach under a broken sky.
O not departure, but a voyage done!
The bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps
Its red rust downward, and the long vine creeps Beside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.
Now that I have your heart by heart, I see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/zlv74n/poem_song_for_the_last_act_by_louise_bogan/
Traveling through the Dark by William Stafford,William Stafford,"'Traveling through the Dark' by William Stafford is a short but effective poem about the death of a deer. The speaker starts the poem by describing how he saw a deer on the side of the road and decided to stop and roll the body off and out of the way. This, he says, could save someone from losing their life. Before he can roll the deer into the river, he realizes that she's pregnant and that the fawn is still alive. This makes him pause. He considers what he's supposed to do in this scenario while the wilderness listens. He chooses to go ahead with his original plan and rolls her into the river.","Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.
By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing; she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.
My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting, alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.
The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights; under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red; around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.
I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—, then pushed her over the edge into the river.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/42775/traveling-through-the-dark
The Negro Speaks of Rivers by Langston Hughes,Langston Hughes,"'The Negro Speaks of Rivers' by Langston Hughes is told from the perspective of a man who has seen the great ages of the world alongside the banks of the most important rivers. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he knows rivers very well. There are a few in particular he wants to share with the reader. All of them are among the largest and longest on the planet. They have also all played host to some of the most important historical events and civilizations on the planet. The speaker has seen humankind's first moments alongside the Euphrates, participated in the building of the pyramids, and listened to the Mississippi while Abraham Lincoln was sibling down it. The poem concludes with a repetition of the opening lines, making sure a reader is aware of the speaker's deep connection to the bodies of water.","I’ve known rivers:
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

I’ve known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44428/the-negro-speaks-of-rivers
The Swing by Robert Louis Stevenson,Robert Louis Stevenson,"'The Swing' by Robert Louis Stevenson is a simple profession of love for the joys of swinging told from the perspective by a young speaker. The poem begins with the speaker asking the listener how much they like to swing up into the blue air. This is a rhetorical question, as seen by the speaker's quick response. They love it more than anything and think it's the best thing a child could spend their time doing. In the next stanza, the child speaker describes how when they are swinging at their highest height they are able to see over a wall and into the countryside beyond. There are farmlands and farm animals, all waiting to be discovered. On the way back down they see the brown roof of their home. The descent is dragged out by the long “o” sounds utilized by Stevenson, but once they reach the bottom they quickly escape from the mundane and travel back up into the sky.","How do you like to go up in a swing,
Up in the air so blue?
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing
Ever a child can do!
Up in the air and over the wall,
Till I can see so wide,
Rivers and trees and cattle and all
Over the countryside—
Till I look down on the garden green,
Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again,
Up in the air and down!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43166/the-swing-56d221dc6ffc4
Luke Havergal by Edwin Arlington Robinson,Edwin Arlington Robinson,"Luke Havergal' by Edwin Arlington Robinson is told from inside the mind of Luke Havergal, a man who is being tempted to suicide by the prospect of love in death. The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is time for Luke Havergal to go to the “western gate.” It is here he will leave his present unsatisfactory life and find a new one. If he does cross over, which the speaker believes is inevitable, he will have a new lover. There is a woman waiting for him. In the following lines, the speaker describes a light in Luke Havergal's head. It is blinding him to his correct path. She intends to put it out and steer him to the gate. The speaker makes it clear she has come from the other side to guide him. The poem concludes with the speaker reiterating the text of the first stanza and making sure that Luke Havergal understands that his chance to find this woman is not unlimited. He must go now if he ever wants to be happy.","Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There where the vines cling crimson on the wall,
And in the twilight wait for what will come.
The leaves will whisper there of her, and some,
Like flying words, will strike you as they fall;
But go, and if you listen she will call.
Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal—
Luke Havergal.


No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies
To rift the fiery night that’s in your eyes;
But there, where western glooms are gathering,
The dark will end the dark, if anything:
God slays Himself with every leaf that flies,
And hell is more than half of paradise.
No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies—
In eastern skies.


Out of a grave I come to tell you this,
Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss
That flames upon your forehead with a glow
That blinds you to the way that you must go.
Yes, there is yet one way to where she is,
Bitter, but one that faith may never miss.
Out of a grave I come to tell you this—
To tell you this.


There is the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There are the crimson leaves upon the wall.
Go, for the winds are tearing them away,—
Nor think to riddle the dead words they say,
Nor any more to feel them as they fall;
But go, and if you trust her she will call.
There is the western gate, Luke Havergal—

London Bridge is Falling Down,A List of Popular Nursery Rhymes,"The Fair Lady In regards to who the very mysterious and important “fair lady” is in the poem, there are also several theories. She might be the Virgin Mary, whose birthday falls on the supposed day the Viking attacked occurred. Others suggest that “she” is Matilda of Scotland, a consort to Henry I who was responsible for building a series of bridges. One final theory, she might be Eleanor of Provence, a consort of Henry II. She was attacked on the bridge with eggs and stones in response to political discontent.","London Bridge is falling down,

Winter in the Boulevard by D.H. Lawrence,D.H. Lawrence,"Winter in the Boulevard' by D.H. Lawrence describes the coming of the winter frost and the perilous position it places all life on the “Boulevard.” The poem begins with the speaker stating that the frost has landed on the trees and started to strangle the reaming leaves from their branches. They are cut down, blown away, and buried in the snow. Their “fantasies” of making it through the season are no more. Within the next lines, the speaker describes how the now naked trees are forced to confront the coming season. They are at risk from the weather and know it. In the third stanza, the speaker notices a few tiny sparrows huddled together amongst the leaves and twigs. They attempt to keep warm and serve as a reminder that life still exists during this season. The poem concludes with the speaker stating that all life on earth is at the mercy of the “welkin,” or sky and heavens. There is nothing on can do to truly contend with the frost, when it decides to come.","THE frost has settled down upon the trees
And ruthlessly strangled off the fantasies
Of leaves that have gone unnoticed, swept like old
Romantic stories now no more to be told.
The trees down the boulevard stand naked in
thought,
Their abundant summery wordage silenced, caught
In the grim undertow; naked the trees confront
Implacable winter's long, cross-questioning brunt.
Has some hand balanced more leaves in the depths
of the twigs?
Some dim little efforts placed in the threads of the
birch?—
It is only the sparrows, like dead black leaves on
the sprigs,
Sitting huddled against the cerulean, one flesh with
their perch.
The clear, cold sky coldly bethinks itself.
Like vivid thought the air spins bright, and all
Trees, birds, and earth, arrested in the after-thought
Awaiting the sentence out from the welkin brought.",https://americanliterature.com/author/d-h-lawrence/poem/winter-in-the-boulevard
The Gypsy by Edward Thomas,Edward Thomas,"'The Gypsy' by Edward Thomas describes an encounter the speaker had with a band of gypsies and how they transported him with their music. The poem begins with the speaker talking to one gypsy woman. He ends up giving her some tobacco, but wishes he had given her more, especially after hearing her brother play. The majority of the poem is focused on the sights and sounds around the woman's brother. He stamps his feet and sings and plays the “mouth-organ.” The speaker describes the festivities in the camp as “Bacchanal.” In the last lines, the speaker wishes that he could've thanked the family sufficiently for the way he was transported out of his life and into an emotional, dark, and intense mental landscape. This experience has given him something to write about, and he can't pay them back for that.","A fortnight before Christmas Gypsies were everywhere:
Vans were drawn up on wastes, women trailed to the fair.
'My gentleman,' said one, 'you've got a lucky face.'
'And you've a luckier,' I thought, 'if such a grace
And impudence in rags are lucky.' 'Give a penny
For the poor baby's sake.' 'Indeed I have not any
Unless you can give change for a sovereign, my dear.'
'Then just half a pipeful of tobacco can you spare?'
I gave it. With that much victory she laughed content.
I should have given more, but off and away she went
With her baby and her pink sham flowers to rejoin
The rest before I could translate to its proper coin
Gratitude for her grace. And I paid nothing then,
As I pay nothing now with the dipping of my pen
For her brother's music when he drummed the tambourine
And stamped his feet, which made the workmen passing grin,
While his mouth-organ changed to a rascally Bacchanal dance
'Over the hills and far away.' This and his glance
Outlasted all the fair, farmer, and auctioneer,
Cheap-jack, balloon-man, drover with crooked stick, and steer,
Pig, turkey, goose, and duck, Christmas Corpses to be.
Not even the kneeling ox had eyes like the Romany.
That night he peopled for me the hollow wooded land,
More dark and wild than stormiest heavens, that I searched and scanned
Like a ghost new-arrived. The gradations of the dark
Were like an underworld of death, but for the spark
In the Gypsy boy's black eyes as he played and stamped his tune,
'Over the hills and far away', and a crescent moon.",http://ww1lit.nsms.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/items/show/2669
When You Thought Me Poor by Alice Walker,Alice Walker,"When You Thought Me Poor is one such poem — it is a powerful commentary on an unequal society that is well-written enough to be a thought-provoking and intelligent commentary on the way the world can often be, through the eyes — and the pen — of Alice Walker.","When you thought me poor,
my poverty was shaming.
When blackness was unwelcome
we found it best
that I stay home.
When by the miracle
of fierce dreaming and hard work
Life fulfilled our every want
you found me crassly
well off;
not trimly,
inconspicuously wealthy
like your rich friends.
Still black too,
now
I owned too much and too many
of everything.
Woe is me: I became a
success! Blackness, who
knows how?
Became suddenly
in!
What to do?
Now that Fate appears
(for the moment anyhow)
to have dismissed
abject failure
in any case?
Now that moonlight and night
have blessed me.
Now that the sun
unaffected by criticism
of any sort,
implacably beams
the kiss filled magic that creates
the dark and radiant wonder
of my face.",https://www.best-poems.net/poem/when-you-thought-me-poor-by-alice-walker.html
Innocence by Patrick Kavanagh,Patrick Kavanagh,"'Innocence' by Patrick Kavanagh describes the deep connection a farmer has to his land and the farmer's immortal sense of being. The poem begins with the speaker stating that there are those who have in the past made fun of the “one” he loves. This “one” is a patch of land. It is not particularly big, but it is special to the speaker. Others see the farm as too contained and separate from the rest of the world though. It is “innocent” and has made the speaker “innocent” as well. There were times that this thought bothered the speaker, but he always came back to the land in the end. In the last two stanzas, the speaker admires the land he has and considers his own agelessness. His continual existence within this one spot has taken him beyond a mortal understanding of time. Now, he is without age or death. The only way he could die is if he left the land he loves.","They laughed at one I loved-
The triangular hill that hung
Under the Big Forth. They said
That I was bounded by the whitethorn hedges
Of the little farm and did not know the world.
But I knew that love's doorway to life
Is the same doorway everywhere.
Ashamed of what I loved
I flung her from me and called her a ditch
Although she was smiling at me with violets.

But now I am back in her briary arms
The dew of an Indian Summer lies
On bleached potato-stalks
What age am I?

I do not know what age I am,
I am no mortal age;
I know nothing of women,
Nothing of cities,
I cannot die
Unless I walk outside these whitethorn hedge",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8507399-Innocence-by-Patrick-Kavanagh
"Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness by John Donne",John Donne,"Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness' by John Donne is written from the perspective of a dying man hoping to gain access to heaven. The poem begins with the speaker describing the room in which he is dying. He will soon leave it for the “holy room.” Here he will become a music-filled saint, tuned to God's liking. The words he is speaking are used as preparation for what is to come later. He is bracing himself for his own death and entry to Heaven. The speaker describes how there are physicians around him mapping out his body as if they are “Cosmographers.” They are seeking out their own answers and he is seeking the discovery of another world. Death is not something he is afraid of. In fact, he sees it as being an integral part of life, just as the crucifixion was a part of the resurrection. In the last stanzas, he asks that God recognize his goodness and the good he has done on earth through his written works. If God can do this, perhaps he will enter into Heaven just like Christ.","Since I am coming to that holy room,
Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
I shall be made thy music; as I come
I tune the instrument here at the door,
And what I must do then, think here before.
Whilst my physicians by their love are grown
Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie
Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown
That this is my south-west discovery,
Per fretum febris, by these straits to die,
I joy, that in these straits I see my west;
For, though their currents yield return to none,
What shall my west hurt me? As west and east
In all flat maps (and I am one) are one,
So death doth touch the resurrection.
Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are
The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?
Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,
All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,
Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.
We think that Paradise and Calvary,
Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;
Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;
As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,
May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.
So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;
By these his thorns, give me his other crown;
And as to others' souls I preach'd thy word,
Be this my text, my sermon to mine own:
""Therefore that he may raise, the Lord throws down.""",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44114/hymn-to-god-my-god-in-my-sickness
The Invitation by Oriah Mountain Dreamer,Oriah Mountain Dreamer,"The Invitation' by Oriah Mountain Dreamer is made up of a speaker's interests and disinterests when it comes to a possible relationship. The poem begins with the speaker making two initial statements about what she does and does not want to know about a possible lover. First, she does not care what they do for a living. She does care about their dreams and what their heart aches for secretly. The speaker goes on to add that she wants her life and that of her lover to be filled with the great adventure of being alive. One of the most poignant metaphors crafted by Dreamer in the text is the comparison between the listener's interests and planets. They circle around this person, making up their exterior image. This is a perfect example of the type of information the speaker doesn't care about. She continues on to develop another important aspect of the text, how the listener stands up to scrutiny, loss, and disaster. Her lover's strength mentally and emotionally is crucial. They must not flinch from the “flames” and be willing to stand up to their own, and even her, failures. As 'The Invitation' progresses she adds that she doesn't care about her listener's children, past, or the mask they wear in public. Everything she needs to know comes from within her lover's soul. The poem concludes with the speaker expressing her interest in knowing if her listener could live within their own mind, without the company of others. Their interior fortitude is a deal-breaker for her.","It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart’s longing.

It doesn’t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn’t interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life’s betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.

I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it, or fade it, or fix it.

I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own; if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, be realistic, remember the limitations of being human.

It doesn’t interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself. If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. If you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy.

I want to know if you can see Beauty even when it is not pretty every day. And if you can source your own life from its presence.

I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand at the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, ‘Yes.’

It doesn’t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone and do what needs to be done to feed the children.

It doesn’t interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.

It doesn’t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.",https://www.mindfulnessassociation.net/words-of-wonder/the-invitation-oriah-mountain-dreamer/
Fear by Eva Picková,Eva Picková,"Fear' by Eva Picková is a haunting and memorable poem that focuses on one young girl's experiences during the Holocaust. The poem details the impact of typhus on her community as those she cares for suffering and die around her. The lines clearly convey her terrified tone and the fear that she experiences on a daily basis. In the third stanza, she considers whether or not it would be better to die than to continue on this way but quickly changes her mind. She decides instead that she wants to, and her friends and family need to, live to make the world better.","Today the ghetto knows a different fear,
Close in it grip, death weilds an icy scythe.
An sickeness spreads a terror in its wake,
The victims of its shadow weep and writhe.

Today fathers heartbeat tell his fright.
And Mother's bend their heads into their hands,
Now children choke and die with typhus here,
A bitter tax is taken ftom their hands.

My heart still beats inside my breast
While friends depart for other worlds.
Perhaps its better-who can say?
Than watching this, to die today?

No,No, my God we want to live.
Not watch our numbers melt away.
We want to have a better world,
We want to work-we must not die!",https://poetrypoem.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=312738&sitename=starlovepoet&poemoffset=58&displaypoem=t&item=poetry
To A Louse by Robert Burns,Robert Burns,"To A Louse' by Robert Burns describes a louse which was crawling on a lady's decorous bonnet at a church quire. 'To A Louse' by Robert Burns is a verse describing a louse and its features. The poet has seen it crawling impudently over the gauzes and laces of a fair lady's bonnet. Bonnet is a woman's hat tied under the chin and with a brim framing the face. Ladies put on this hat as an accompaniment. However, in this poem, the poet finds the louse at once crawling and at times hiding. Sometimes it tries to peep out showing its blood-filled belly and its noticeable legs. The poet talks with it as if it's a little devil sinning the sanctified environment of a church! It is destined to feed on some poor lady or boy's blood, not of that beautiful lady. Moreover, the poet thinks that louse symbolizes the nature of human vanity. The louse in its ugly form proves the futility of one's thinking about oneself. ","Ha! whare ye gaun, ye crowlan ferlie!

I canna say but ye strunt rarely,
Owre gawze and lace;

There ye may creep, and sprawl, and sprattle,

In shoals and nations;
Whare horn nor bane ne’er daur unsettle,
Your thick plantations.

Now haud you there, ye’re out o’ sight,
Below the fatt’rels, snug and tight,
Na faith ye yet! ye’ll no be right,

The Panther by Ogden Nash,Ogden Nash,"'The Panther' by Ogden Nash is a short children's poem that uses humor to describe a leopard and a panther. The poem addresses the similarities between panthers and leopards and then notes, with humor, that the panther is different because it hasn't been “peppered.” Its coat is solid versus the leopard whose coat is spotted. The speaker also says that if “you,” the reader, ever see a panther “crouch,” that you need to be prepared to say “ouch.” The poem concludes with one more humorous moment that suggests readers should stay away from these powerful animals.","The panther is like a leopard,
Except it hasn't been peppered.
Should you behold a panther crouch,
Prepare to say Ouch.
Better yet, if called by a panther,
Don't anther.",http://thingfinder.blogspot.com/2008/10/panther-by-ogden-nash.html
Futility by Wilfred Owen,Wilfred Owen,"‘Futility’ follows the aftermath of a battlefield. A soldier has died, and his companions reminisce on death and its proximity to wakefulness. Images of death and life are intertwined throughout the poem, and the final effect is of a poem that is close to Biblical, tortured, and beautiful, but ultimately a lament on the waste of innocent lives.","Move him into the sun—
Gently its touch awoke him once,
At home, whispering of fields half-sown.
Always it woke him, even in France,
Until this morning and this snow.
If anything might rouse him now
The kind old sun will know.

Think how it wakes the seeds—
Woke once the clays of a cold star.
Are limbs, so dear-achieved, are sides
Full-nerved, still warm, too hard to stir?
Was it for this the clay grew tall?
—O what made fatuous sunbeams toil
To break earth's sleep at all?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57283/futility-56d23aa2d4b57
Sing a Song of Sixpence by Mother Goose,A List of Popular Nursery Rhymes,"Meaning of Sing a Song of Sixpence 'Sing a Song of Sixpence' by Mother Goose has several different possible meanings. There is historical evidence that suggests the act of putting a live bird in a pie was something that really happened. There are records of a recipe calling for that very thing from 1549. It was also referred to in another cookbook by John Nott in 1725. The bird was meant to remain alive and fly out when the pie was cut. Iona and Peter Opie's The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes from 1951 acknowledges a variety of historical events that could be tied to the rhyme. The moon and sun could represent a queen and king, they say, the blackbirds the hours of the day or an allusion to monks. Unsurprisingly, the rhyme has also been connected to Henry VIII and his marriages Anne Boleyn is suggested to be the maid and Catherine of Aragon, the queen. There is no hard evidence for this theory.","Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds
Baked in a pie.

When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing—
Wasn't that a dainty dish
To set before the king?

The king was in the counting-house
Counting out his money,
The queen was in the parlor
Eating bread and honey,

The maid was in the garden
Hanging out the clothes.
Along came a blackbird
And snipped off her nose.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42900/sing-a-song-of-sixpence
"Two Scavengers in a Truck, Two Beautiful People in a Mercedes by Lawrence Ferlinghetti",Lawrence Ferlinghetti ,"'Two Scavengers in a Truck, Two Beautiful People in a Mercedes' by Lawrence Ferlinghetti is a poem about class differences in the United States. The poem is set in San Francisco at a stoplight and features a comparison between garbagemen riding on the back of their truck and a wealthy, “elegant” couple in their Mercedes. The class differences and economic circumstances could not be juxtaposed to a greater degree. The poem ends with an allusion to the fact that the “gulf” shouldn't exist within the United States.","At the stoplight waiting for the light
nine a.m. downtown San Francisco
a bright yellow garbage truck
with two garbagemen in red plastic blazers
standing on the back stoop
one on each side hanging on
and looking down into
an elegant open Mercedes
with an elegant couple in it
The man
in a hip three-piece linen suit
with shoulder-length blond hair and sunglassed
The young blond woman so casually coifed
with short skirt and coloured stockings
on the way to his architect's office

And the two scavengers up since four a.m.
grungy from their route
on the way home
The older of the two with grey iron hair
and hunched back
looking down like some
gargoyle Quasimodo
And the younger of the two
also with sunglasses and long hair
about the same age as the Mercedes driver

And both scavengers gazing down
as from a great distance
at the cool couple
as if they were watching some odourless TV ad
in which everything is always possible

And the very red light for an instant
holding all four close together
as if anything at all were possible
between them
across that small gulf
in the high sea
of this democracy.",https://puisipoesy.blogspot.com/2007/05/two-scavengers-in-truck-two-beautiful.html
Omens by Cecilia Llompart,Cecilia Llompart,"Omens' by Cecilia Llompart is a dark and strange poem that uses horror tropes to speak on omens, dreams, deaths, the future, and the past. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that set out a world that is less about omens, dead birds, drowned men, and dreams than it is about analysis and photographs. She juxtaposes crime scenes with ants feasting on the corpse of a dead bird in the first lines and then goes on to discuss her personal dreams and what they may or may not say about life in general.","The dead bird, color of a bruise,
and smaller than an eye
swollen shut,
is king among omens.
Who can blame the ants for feasting?
Let him cast the first crumb.
~
We once tended the oracles.
Now we rely on a photograph
a fingerprint
a hand we never saw
coming.
~
A man draws a chalk outline
first in his mind
around nothing
then around the body
of another man.
He does this without thinking.
~
What can I do about the white room I left
behind? What can I do about the great stones
I walk among now? What can I do
but sing.
Even a small cut can sing all day.
~
There are entire nights
I would take back.
Nostalgia is a thin moon,
disappearing
into a sky like cold,
unfeeling iron.
~
I dreamed
you were a drowned man, crown
of phosphorescent, seaweed in your hair,
water in your shoes. I woke up desperate
for air.
~
In another dream, I was a field
and you combed through me
searching for something
you only thought you had lost.
~
What have we left at the altar of sorrow?
What blessed thing will we leave tomorrow?",https://poets.org/poem/omens
Poem at Thirty-Nine by Alice Walker,Alice Walker,"'Poem at Thirty-Nine' by Alice Walker describes, through a first-person narrative, what the speaker misses about her father. The poem begins with the speaker clearly stating how much she misses her father and how she regrets the hard life he had to live. She describes the ways that her father taught her. These range from how to cook to how to save money for a better future. She closely associates her father with money and banking slips. He was frugal from a young age and passed that trait onto her. She describes his movements in the kitchen and how now, after he is gone, she has taken on his eccentricities, sharing food as liberally as he did and never living the same day twice. Poem at Thirty-Nine concludes with the speaker finding peace in her memories and the thought that her father would be proud of the woman she has become.","How i miss my father.
I wish he had not been
so tired
when i was
born

Writing deposit slips and checks
i think of him.
He taught me how.
This is the form,
he must have said:
the way it is done.
I learned to see
bits of paper
as a way
to escape
the life he knew
and even in high school
had a savings
account.


He taught me
that telling the truth
did not always mean
a beating;
though many of my truths
must have grieved him
before the end.

How I miss my father!
He cooked like a person
dancing
in a yoga meditation
and craved the voluptuous
sharing
of good food.

Now I look and cook just like him:
my brain light;
tossing this and that
into the pot;
seasoning none of my life
the same way twice; happy to feed
whoever strays my way.

He would have grown
to admire
the women I've become:
cooking, writing, chopping wood,
staring into the fire.",https://genius.com/Alice-walker-poem-at-thirty-nine-annotated
Fire and Ice by Robert Frost,Robert Frost,"Throughout history, there has always been a seeming fascination with how the world will end. In recent years, these discussions have centered around nuclear disaster, immense climate change, and general cynicism. Two thousand years ago (give or take), the Revelations chapter was added into the Christian Bible, detailing a prophetic vision of the end of the world. This has long been a topic embedded in the human psyche. At some point between the present and Revelations’ authorship (closer to the present though), Robert Frost added his own ideas to the mix, and the result was ‘Fire and Ice’, one of his most well-known poems, and certainly one of his most powerful ones. This poem is known for its simplicity and biting message, as well as its call to stop and think, offering a different perspective on the end of everything.","Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice
Digging by Seamus Heaney,Seamus Heaney,"This poem is autobiographical in nature. The speaker, presumably Heaney, is sitting at his writing desk, preparing to write, when he hears his father working in the garden outside. This conjures memories of the speaker as a young boy, listening and watching as his father digs in the potato garden. The speaker marvels at how well his father digs, which conjures an even older memory of his grandfather, his father's father, completing the arduous task of digging through peat moss. Toward the end of the poem, the speaker writes as though he can smell the potatoes from the garden and the peat moss his grandfather has dug. He confesses that he does not have a spade like the two generations before him, but he does have a pen which he will use to “dig.”","Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound When the spade sinks into gravelly ground: My father, digging. I look down
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds Bends low, comes up twenty years away Stooping in rhythm through potato drills Where he was digging.
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God, the old man could handle a spade. Just like his old man.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner’s bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
Over his shoulder, going down and down
For the good turf. Digging.
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.
Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I’ll dig with it.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/47555/digging
Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers by Adrienne Rich,Adrienne Rich,"Aunt Jennifer's Tigers' by Adrienne Rich is a multilayered poem that uses the images of sewn tigers to talk about the institution of marriage. In the first lines of this poem the speaker, who is unnamed, describes Aunt Jennifer's work. She's creating a needlepoint image of tigers. They're beautiful, described as brightly shining gemstones living in green canvas. There is also the addition of men in the image. They're watching the tigers who move without fear. The speaker spends time describing how fast Jennifer's fingers move and the weight of the wedding ring on her finger. The speaker looks to the future at the end of the poem. One day Jennifer is going to die and her frightened hands will stop moving. But, the tigers will not.","Aunt Jennifer's tigers prance across a screen,
Bright topaz denizens of a world of green.
They do not fear the men beneath the tree;
They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.

Aunt Jennifer's finger fluttering through her wool
Find even the ivory needle hard to pull.
The massive weight of Uncle's wedding band
Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer's hand.

When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie
Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.
The tigers in the panel that she made
Will go on prancing, proud and unafraid.",https://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/rich-jennifer-tiger.html
Hard Times by John Ashbery,John Ashbery,"Hard Times' by John Ashbery is a poem where the speaker openly ponders upon life, mortality, and the way people live in the 20th-century world. In the first verse, Ashbery's speaker expresses that people have busy lives and miss out on spending time with the dear ones in their lives. He says that someday, they will have time, but by then, it will not matter anymore because life is short and random. In the last two verses, the poet's tone becomes dystopian as he describes how the planets around the earth are “decoration,” which speaks to the peculiar way in which the speaker thinks. Lastly, the speaker describes how the couple completed their trip to California successfully. They can deem themselves as different from other people because they spent time together in California. It is clear whether they did not make memories they would cherish for the rest of their lives. Instead, the memories of living there would come to haunt them. ","Trust me. The world is run on a shoestring.
They have no time to return the calls in hell
And pay dearly for those wasted minutes. Somewhere
In the future it will filter down through all the proceedings

But by then it will be too late, the festive ambience
Will linger on but it won't matter. More or less
Succinctly they will tell you what we've all known for years:
That the power of this climate is only to conserve itself.

Whatever twists around it is decoration and can never
Be looked at as something isolated, apart. Get it? And
He flashed a mouthful of aluminum teeth there in the darkness
To tell however it gets down, that it does, at last.

Once they made the great trip to California
And came out of it flushed. And now every day
Will have to dispel the notion of being like all the others.
In time, it gets to stand with the wind, but by then the night is closed off.",https://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/hardtimes.html
Abou Ben Adhem by Leigh Hunt,Leigh Hunt,"Abou Ben Adhem' by Leigh Hunt speaks on God's love and Christian morals of love, peace, and care for one's neighbor. In the first lines of this poem, Hunt starts out the story of Abou Ben Adhem by blessing him. He has just woken up from a “deep dream of peace” to a lovely room that's filled with moonlight. It turns out that it was an angel that woke him. The angel is writing in a book, taking down the names of all those who love God. Adhem realizes that his name is not on the list. So, rather than ask to be added, he tells the angel to make a list of people who love their “fellow men” and put his name on it. Through this request, his name gets added to a list of those blessed by God.","Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel writing in a book of gold:—
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the presence in the room he said,
""What writest thou?""—The vision raised its head,
And with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, ""The names of those who love the Lord.""
""And is mine one?"" said Abou. ""Nay, not so,""
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still; and said, ""I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow men.""
The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had blest,
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44433/abou-ben-adhemm
Old Men by Kenneth Fearing,Kenneth Fearing,"'Old Men' by Kenneth Fearing depicts the lives and hopes of the older generation. They are seen as frail and unachieved, yet there is still much that they hope to finish in their lives. Fearing suggests that old men have the potential that society doesn't really understand. The first stanza is designated to explore the stereotype of old men. Particularly, Fearing looks at how they are forgotten, fading into the background. Yet, stanza two focuses on the promise of the future. Many of these forgotten old men have the potential to do great things. Fearing suggests that they can achieve their dreams and should not be underestimated.","They are the raw, monotonous skies,
The faded placards and iron rails
Passed by in narrow streets of rain.
Theirs are the indistinct thin cries
Heard in a long sleep that fails
In strange confusion and numb pain.But old men have their deep dreams
They follow on quiet afternoons
At intervals, through distant streets.
Their lives come near them in warm streams
Of tonic hope. And orange moons
Shine magically on stark defeats.",https://ozofe.com/kenneth-fearing/old-men-4/
To Sappho I by Sara Teasdale,Sara Teasdale,"'To Sappho I' by Sara Teasdale speaks on the beauty of the past as seen from a tainted future that has lost its joy and magic. The poem begins with the speaker addressing Sappho, a female poet of ancient Greece, and describing the world in which she must have lived. It was a happy time in which nature was pristine and there was no “doubt” present in everyday life. The doubt that the speaker is describing can refer to doubt in oneself or doubt in one's purpose in the world. This is backed up in the next lines as the speaker refers to the earth as being half worn out by the progress that humankind has made. There is no more need for magic or myths and “nymphs and satyrs” have vanished from the eye of the people. The poem concludes with the speaker comparing Sappho's world to that of the modern age. There is no longer the dedication to gods and goddesses, nor is there the desire to explore the mysteries of the Earth as they have already been mapped. The time in which the ancient poet lived was before Venus, or Aphrodite, was lost from the water, and before Ceres, or Demeter, lost Persephone to Hades. These myths form a before and after wall to the two worlds of these poets.","Impassioned singer of the happy time.
When all the world was waking into morn,
And dew still glistened on the tangled thorn,
And lingered on the branches of the lime, 
Oh peerless singer of the golden rhyme,
Happy wert thou to live ere doubt was born, 
Before the joy of life was half out-worn,
And nymphs and satyrs vanished from your clime.
Then maidens bearing parsley in their hands
Wound thro' the groves to where the goddess stands,
And mariners might sail for unknown lands
Past sea-clasped islands veiled in mystery, 
And Venus still was shining from the sea,
And Ceres had not lost Persephone.",https://americanliterature.com/author/sara-teasdale/poem/to-sappho-i
The House of Life: 19. Silent Noon by Dante Gabriel Rossetti,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"“The House of Life: 19. Silent Noon” by Dante Gabriel Rossetti describes an “inarticulate” moment of peace that two lovers spend within the grass of a pasture. The poem begins with the speaker stating a simple fact about his lover's hand, that it appears to him like “rosy blooms” as it peeks through the long grass in which they are reclining. He can tell from her eyes that she, as he does, appreciates the peace of this moment. They both know that it is not going to last forever, but that only increases the beauty. As the speaker describes their surroundings it is as if everything has been enhanced. The pasture is “gleam[ing] and gloom[ing]” as the clouds “scatter and amass” in front of the sun. The couple has buried themselves amongst the grasses, creating a sort of nest from which they are able to look out at the flowers and plants that surround them. The silence they are existing in is so still, it is like an hourglass. In the second stanza, the speaker describes his appreciation for this moment. He and his lover “clasp” the time they have together to their chests and take none of it for granted. They know that soon it will be over and they will have to depart again. In the final lines, the speaker describes the presence of silence as being a physical representation of the love the two share.","Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,—
The finger-points look through like rosy blooms:
Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms
'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass.
All round our nest, far as the eye can pass,
Are golden kingcup fields with silver edge
Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge.
'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass.
Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly
Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:—
So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above.
Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower,
This close-companioned inarticulate hour
When twofold silence was the song of love.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45009/the-house-of-life-19-silent-noon
An Apple Gathering by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"An Apple Gathering' by Christina Rossetti describes the plight of a woman who had a relationship before marriage, effectively ending her chance at a good life. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she chose to pick the pink flowers from her apple tree. This choice changed the course of her life. Rather than wait for marriage and gather her apples when they were ripe, she engaged in a sexual relationship with a man who did not love her. When she returns to the tree, and there are no apples to harvest, she falls into a deep depression. She realizes that the prospect of her having a good life is virtually zero. The speaker returns to the path she traveled and becomes more dejected and overwhelmed as she passes others with full baskets.","I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple-tree
And wore them all that evening in my hair:
Then in due season when I went to see
I found no apples there.
With dangling basket all along the grass
As I had come I went the selfsame track:
My neighbours mocked me while they saw me pass
So empty-handed back.
Lilian and Lilias smiled in trudging by,
Their heaped-up basket teased me like a jeer;
Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky,
Their mother's home was near.
Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full,
A stronger hand than hers helped it along;
A voice talked with her through the shadows cool
More sweet to me than song.
Ah Willie, Willie, was my love less worth
Than apples with their green leaves piled above?
I counted rosiest apples on the earth
Of far less worth than love.
So once it was with me you stooped to talk
Laughing and listening in this very lane:
To think that by this way we used to walk
We shall not walk again!
I let me neighbours pass me, ones and twos
And groups; the latest said the night grew chill,
And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews
Fell fast I loitered still.",https://poets.org/poem/apple-gathering
The Locket by John Montague,John Montague,"The Locket' By John Montague depicts memories of the troubled relationship between the poet and his mother after she died. The poem takes the reader through a series of moments, from his birth to his mother's death. Their relationship was fraught from the moments of his birth. Montague describes how from the start his mother was disappointed and pained by him. He felt guilt over this and tried throughout his life to make her love him. She sent him away in his youth but he continued to visit her for a time until she told him to stop. The poem concludes with the revelation that throughout her life she wore a locket with the poet's picture inside.","Sing a last song
for the lady who has gone,
fertile source of guilt and pain.
The worst birth in the annals of Brooklyn,
that was my cue to come on,
my first claim to fame.

Naturally, she longed for a girl,
and all my infant curls of brown
couldn’t excuse my double blunder
coming out the wrong sex,
and the wrong way around.
Not readily forgiven,

So you never nursed me
and when all my father’s songs
couldn’t sweeten the lack of money,
when poverty comes throught the door
love flies up your chimney,
your favourite saying,

Then you gave me away,
might never have known me,
if I had not cycled down
to court you like a young man,
teasingly untying your apron,
drinking by the fire, yarning

Of your wild, young days
which didn’t last long, for you,
lovely Molly, the belle of your small town,
landed up mournful and chill
as the constant rain that lashes it
wound into your cocoon of pain.

Standing in that same hallway,
Don’t come again.you say, roughly,
I start to get fond of you, John,
and then you are up and gone;
the harsh logic of a forlorn woman
resigned to being alone.

And still, mysterious blessing,
I never knew, until you were gone,
that, always around your neck
you wore an oval locket
with an old picture in it,
of a child in Brooklyn.",https://ajd8.wordpress.com/2016/12/12/the-locket-by-john-montague/
I am Trying to Break Your Heart by Kevin Young,Kevin Young,"'I am Trying to Break Your Heart' by Kevin Young depicts a speaker's confused emotions in regard to a flagging love affair. The poem begins with the speaker telling his lover, someone with whom he has been in love with, that he wants to mount their head on the wall. This violent statement speaks to a need to destroy, but also to own. It is an idea that thrills the speaker, as it would allow him to take back something from the listener. Their love is not what it used to be, as is seen through the cold tone of these lines. In the second half of 'I am Trying to Break Your Heart' the emotions are more confused. There is some tenderness in his heart. This is seen through his desire to nurture what remains of the love, to put the taxidermy lover back together, and make sure he doesn't lose any skin.","I am hoping
to hang your head
on my wall
in shame—
the slightest taxidermy
thrills me. Fish
forever leaping
on the living-room wall—
paperweights made
from skulls
of small animals.
I want to wear
your smile on my sleeve
& break
your heart like a horse
or its leg. Weeks of being
bucked off, then
all at once, you're mine—
Put me down.
I want to call you thine
to tattoo mercy
along my knuckles. I assassin
down the avenue
I hope
to have you forgotten
by noon. To know you
by your knees
palsied by prayer.
Loneliness is a science—
consider the taxidermist's
tender hands
trying to keep from losing
skin, the bobcat grin
of the living.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57448/i-am-trying-to-break-your-heart
To Brooklyn Bridge by Hart Crane,Hart Crane,"'To Brooklyn Bridge' by Hart Crane presents a chain of images associated with the Brooklyn bridge. 'To Brooklyn Bridge' by Hart Crane begins with the image of the seagulls flying over the bridge at dawn. Thereafter the poet goes on to refer to the modern images such as some page of figures filed away and the cinema screen. Moreover, the poet presents a picture of the silvery bridge at dawn. Then, again the poet shifts from the description of the bridge to an insane who jumps off the bridge. In the following stanzas, the poet associates spiritual elements with the bridge. Moreover, he thinks that the bridge connects earth to heaven. At last, there is a request to the bridge for coming down from its height and be one of them.","How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest
The seagull’s wings shall dip and pivot him,
Shedding white rings of tumult, building high
Over the chained bay waters Liberty—
Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes As apparitional as sails that cross
Some page of figures to be filed away;
—Till elevators drop us from our day ...
I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights
With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene
Never disclosed, but hastened to again,
Foretold to other eyes on the same screen;
And Thee, across the harbor, silver paced
As though the sun took step of thee yet left
Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,—
Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!
Out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft
A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,
Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,
A jest falls from the speechless caravan.
Down Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,
A rip-tooth of the sky’s acetylene;
All afternoon the cloud flown derricks turn ...
Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.
And obscure as that heaven of the Jews,
Thy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow
Of anonymity time cannot raise:
Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.
O harp and altar, of the fury fused,
(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)
Terrific threshold of the prophet’s pledge,
Prayer of pariah, and the lover’s cry,
Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift
Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,
Beading thy path—condense eternity:
And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.
Under thy shadow by the piers I waited
Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.
The City’s fiery parcels all undone,
Already snow submerges an iron year ...
O Sleepless as the river under thee,
Vaulting the sea, the prairies’ dreaming sod, Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend
And of the curveship lend a myth to God.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/43262/the-bridge-to-brooklyn-bridge
Two Songs by Adrienne Rich,Adrienne Rich,"Two Songs' by Adrienne Rich describes a speaker's physical intimacy with a man out of sheer lust, not for emotional love. In the first song, the speaker shares the incident directly. It occurred to her on a morning at about ten o'clock. It was drizzling outside and within she felt a craving for the young man. She made love with him, whom she did not love. Rich uses the plowing metaphor in order to describe the act of lovemaking. In the second song, the speaker focuses on the “old last act” or the culmination of the act. She can vividly remember how they fainted together in the bed. She felt as if they shot for the moon during lovemaking. In the end, she talks about how they thanked each other as if they both were invested in a mechanical act, devoid of the emotion of love. ","Sex, as they harshly call it,

I fell into this morning

at ten o'clock, a drizzling hour

of traffic and wet newspapers.

I thought of him who yesterday

clearly didn't

turn me to a hot field

ready for plowing,

and longing for that young man

pierced me to the roots

bathing every vein, etc.

All day he appears to me

touchingly desirable,

a prize one could wreck one's peace for.

I'd call it love if love

didn't take so many years

but lust too is a jewel

a sweet flower and what

pure happiness to know

all our high-toned questions

breed in a lively animal.

2

That ""old last act""!

And yet sometimes

all seems post coitum triste

and I a mere bystander.

Somebody else is going off,

getting shot to the moon.

Or, a moon-race!

Split seconds after

my opposite number lands

I make it---

we lie fainting together

at a crater-edge

heavy as mercury in our moonsuits

till he speaks---

in a different language

yet one I've picked up

through cultural exchanges. . .

we murmur the first moonwords:

Spasibo. Thanks. O.K.",https://www.d.umn.edu/~tbacig/cst1010/chs/rich.html
Philomena by Matthew Arnold,Matthew Arnold,"The Myth of Philomena Before a reader can fully understand this piece by Matthew Arnold, it is beneficial to read the myth on which the poem is based. The Greek story of Philomena can be found here. To summarize, Philomena was the sister of Procne, who married the Thracian king, Tereus. After being married for a number of years and living in Thrace, Procne wanted to see her sister, Philomena. Tereus went to retrieve Philomena from Athens and on the way back Tereus assaulted Philomena in a small cabin in the woods. He then abandoned her and cut out her tongue. After this tragedy had befallen Philomena she wove her story into a tapestry and had it delivered to her sister in Thrace. Procne, wanting to take revenge on her husband, killed her son by Tereus and served the boy to his father during a meal. Tereus found out what had happened and attempted to kill Procne. The gods saved the two women by turning Philomena into a nightingale and Procne into a swallow. Tereus was transformed into a hoopoe, another type of bird.","Hark! ah, the nightingale—
The tawny-throated!
Hark, from that moonlit cedar what a burst!
What triumph! hark!—what pain!
O wanderer from a Grecian shore,
Still, after many years, in distant lands,
Still nourishing in thy bewilder'd brain
That wild, unquench'd, deep-sunken, old-world pain—
Say, will it never heal?
And can this fragrant lawn
With its cool trees, and night,
And the sweet, tranquil Thames,
And moonshine, and the dew,
To thy rack'd heart and brain
Afford no balm?
Dost thou to-night behold,
Here, through the moonlight on this English grass,
The unfriendly palace in the Thracian wild?
Dost thou again peruse
With hot cheeks and sear'd eyes
The too clear web, and thy dumb sister's shame?
Dost thou once more assay
Thy flight, and feel come over thee,
Poor fugitive, the feathery change
Once more, and once more seem to make resound
With love and hate, triumph and agony,
Lone Daulis, and the high Cephissian vale?
Listen, Eugenia—
How thick the bursts come crowding through the leaves!
Again—thou hearest?
Eternal passion!
Eternal pain!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43599/philomela
Never Trust a Mirror by Erin Hanson,Eric Hanson,"'Never Trust a Mirror' by Erin Hanson was written to remind readers that one's reflection, or what they look like, is not an indication of their self-worth. The poem starts with the speaker telling whoever is reading the poem to remember that mirrors are untrustworthy. They show someone looking into them what's on the surface. But, they have no access to what's inside one's mind or heart. Nor can they see “you” when you're living in the happiest moments of life or sleeping peacefully. One should be wary of basing their self-worth off of what they see in the mirror.","Never trust a mirror,
For the mirror always lies,
It makes you think that all your worth,
Can be seen from the outside.
Never trust a mirror,
It only shows you skin deep,
You can't see how your eyelids flutter,
When you're drifting off to sleep,
It doesn't show you what he sees,
When you're only being you,
Or how your eyes just light up,
When you're loving what you do,
It doesn't capture when you're smiling,
Where no one else can see,
And your reflection cannot tell you,
Everything you mean to me,
Never trust a mirror,
For it only shows your skin,
And if you think that it dictates your worth,
It's time you looked within.",https://www.thehealingpoems.com/poem/never-trust-a-mirror
kitchenette building by Gwendolyn Brooks,Gwendolyn Brooks,"kitchenette building' by Gwendolyn Brooks is a moving poem that alludes to the racial wealth gap in Chicago in the early to mid-1900s. Throughout this poem, the speaker describes the day to day life of a group of people who are living in poverty. The “we” that Brooks uses in the poem encompasses everyone in this speaker's vicinity. No one she knows can afford to spend time on dreams, not when there are much more important things to focus on like “rent” and family needs.","We are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan,
Grayed in, and gray. “Dream” makes a giddy sound, not strong
Like “rent,” “feeding a wife,” “satisfying a man.”
But could a dream send up through onion fumes
Its white and violet, fight with fried potatoes
And yesterday’s garbage ripening in the hall,
Flutter, or sing an aria down these rooms
Even if we were willing to let it in,
Had time to warm it, keep it very clean,
Anticipate a message, let it begin?
We wonder. But not well! not for a minute!
Since Number Five is out of the bathroom now,
We think of lukewarm water, hope to get in it.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/43308/kitchenette-building
Goliath and David by Robert Graves,Robert Graves,"Goliath and David' by Robert Graves retells the story of “David and Goliath” in a darker, more realistic manner in which David does not prevail over the giant. The poem begins with the speaker describing the actions of the young David before the battle. In this short stanza, he gathers pebbles from a stream and tries to gain strength from his previous endeavors. In the second part of 'Goliath and David', in which all of the action is contained, the speaker tells a different story of the battle between a giant and a shepherd. As in the traditional manner, David throws a pebble at Goliath's head with his sling. But rather than knock him dead, the giant deflects it with his shield. David throws another, and another, with the same outcome. At this point, he is frustrated and terrified. He “damns” his weapon and takes up another—his staff which is used in his duties as a shepherd's son. The two come to blows, Goliath's metal sword against the wooden staff. With only one swing the boy is felled. His death comes quick and Goliath straddles his body in an act of domination. This retelling of a traditional story shows that in all situations an underdog cannot prevail. In the real world, that which is not contained within fiction, death comes for those with lesser means.","Yet once an earlier David took
Smooth pebbles from the brook:
Out between the lines he went
To that one-sided tournament,
A shepherd boy who stood out fine
And young to fight a Philistine
Clad all in brazen mail. He swears
That he's killed lions, he's killed bears,
And those that scorn the God of Zion
Shall perish so like bear or lion.
But ... the historian of that fight
Had not the heart to tell it right.

Striding within javelin range,
Goliath marvels at this strange
Goodly-faced boy so proud of strength.
David's clear eye measures the length;
With hand thrust back, he cramps one knee,
Poises a moment thoughtfully,
And hurls with a long vengeful swing.
The pebble, humming from the sling
Like a wild bee, flies a sure line
For the forehead of the Philistine;
Then ... but there comes a brazen clink,
And quicker than a man can think
Goliath's shield parries each cast.
Clang! clang! and clang! was David's last.
Scorn blazes in the Giant's eye,
Towering unhurt six cubits high.
Says foolish David, ""Damn your shield!
And damn my sling! but I'll not yield.""
He takes his staff of Mamre oak,
A knotted shepherd-staff that's broke
The skull of many a wolf and fox
Come filching lambs from Jesse's flocks.
Loud laughs Goliath, and that laugh
Can scatter chariots like blown chaff
To rout; but David, calm and brave,
Holds his ground, for God will save.
Steel crosses wood, a flash, and oh!
Shame for beauty's overthrow!
(God's eyes are dim, His ears are shut.)
One cruel backhand sabre-cut
""I'm hit! I'm killed!"" young David cries,
Throws blindly forward, chokes ... and dies.
And look, spike-helmeted, grey, grim,
Goliath straddles over him.",https://americanliterature.com/author/robert-graves/poem/goliath-and-david
Dream Song 14 by John Berryman,John Berryman,"Dream Song 14' by John Berryman describes a speaker's irritation and boredom with every part of his life as well as what is missing from it. The speaker takes the reader through some of the many things in life that bore him. He knows he shouldn't say so, but life itself is boring. He takes no pleasure from books or peoples. The great stories of people like Achilles also bore him. It's not until the last lines of the poem that it becomes relatively clear that the speaker is so bored because he's lost something integral to his life—companionship. A dog is used as a symbol of that missing companionship and the mark it's left behind. ","Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so.
After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,
we ourselves flash and yearn,
and moreover my mother told me as a boy
(repeatedly) 'Ever to confess you're bored
means you have no

Inner Resources.' I conclude now I have no
inner resources, because I am heavy bored.
Peoples bore me,
literature bores me, especially great literature,
Henry bores me, with his plights & gripes
as bad as achilles,

Who loves people and valiant art, which bores me.
And the tranquil hills, & gin, look like a drag
and somehow a dog
has taken itself & its tail considerably away
into mountains or sea or sky, leaving
behind: me, wag.",http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/john_berryman/poems/12008
Wild Swans by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"Wild Swans' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of a speaker's desperation to get out of her current physical and emotional space and find a new, bird-like freedom. The poem begins with the speaker feeling shocked at the sight of wild swans flying over her home. There is something about their shapes on this day that strikes her. She is suddenly determined to look into her heart and pick out the parts of herself that have confined her. The speaker sees her current life as “Tiresome.” She is metaphorically chained to her daily emotional pattern and would like to fly over the town, just like the swans. By the end of the poem the speaker has decided that she is going to leave the suffocating home she's been stuck in for so long. She is also desperate for the swans to come back and show her again how to fly over the town. When this happens her heart will be free, her old life will sit far below her, and all the possibilities the swans have access to will be hers as well.","I looked in my heart while the wild swans went over.
And what did I see I had not seen before?
Only a question less or a question more;
Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying.
Tiresome heart, forever living and dying,
House without air, I leave you and lock your door.
Wild swans, come over the town, come over
The town again, trailing your legs and crying!",https://poets.org/poem/wild-swans
A Ritual to Read to Each Other by William Stafford,William Stafford,"'A Ritual To Read to Each Other' by William Stafford speaks about achieving a world in which relationships are always healthy, balanced, and beneficial. The poem begins with the speaker imagining a scenario in which he does not know his listener and they do not know him. If this was the case between them, or between any other couple in a relationship, there is a chance they will “miss [their] star.” One's shot at creating a fulfilling life can easily slip away if the “wrong god” is followed. He goes on to describe how relationships fall apart through the explosion of childhood experiences and the indifferent “shrug.” These things can be avoided if one is only willing to make their own path. The poem concludes with the speaker asking that everyone listening to the text of the poem make their “signals” clear to one another. Human beings should help each other through the “deep” darkness of life.","f you don't know the kind of person I am
and I don't know the kind of person you are
a pattern that others made may prevail in the world
and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.

For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,
a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break
sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood
storming out to play through the broken dike.

And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,
but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,
I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty
to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,
a remote important region in all who talk:
though we could fool each other, we should consider—
lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.

For it is important that awake people be awake,
or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;
the signals we give — yes or no, or maybe —
should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/58264/a-ritual-to-read-to-each-other
Halloween Party by Kenn Nesbitt,Kenn Nesbitt,"'Halloween Party' by Kenn Nesbitt is a simple, upbeat poem in which the speaker, a young child, describes what happened to him at school around Halloween. In the first stanza, the child spends the lines talking about his Halloween costume. He's dressed up as Dracula and is clearly very proud of that fact. He elaborates on what he looks like and what he's wearing. The second stanza is similar to the first, but it goes into more detail about what he looks like, all the way down to his fingernails. Finally, in the third stanza, it becomes clear that the speaker has made a big mistake. He thought the Halloween part was “today,” but it is not actually until next week. This is something that immediately confronts the speaker when he walks into a school and sees that no one else is wearing a costume. He feels foolish and completely embarrassed about this mistake.","We’re having a Halloween party at school.
I’m dressed up like Dracula. Man, I look cool!
I dyed my hair black, and I cut off my bangs.
I’m wearing a cape and some fake plastic fangs.

I put on some makeup to paint my face white,
like creatures that only come out in the night.
My fingernails, too, are all pointed and red.
I look like I’m recently back from the dead.

My mom drops me off, and I run into school
and suddenly feel like the world’s biggest fool.
The other kids stare like I’m some kind of freak—
the Halloween party is not till next week.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47155/halloween-party
The Difficulty that is Marriage by Paul Durcan,Paul Durcan,"'The Difficulty that is Marriage' by Paul Durcan is a loving sonnet dedicated to the speaker's partner and their sustained marriage. The poem takes the reader through the speaker's emotional connection to their partner. He professes his love for this person and acknowledges both his faults and theirs. Despite anything they might disagree on or be lacking, he believes that he could live forever if he was with this person.","We disagree to disagree, we divide, we differ;
Yet each night as I lie in bed beside you
And you are faraway curled up in sleep
I array the moonlit ceiling with a mosaic of question-marks;
How was it I was so lucky to have ever met you?
I am no brave pagan proud of my mortality
Yet gladly on this changeling earth I should live for ever
If it were with you, my sleeping friend.
I have my troubles and I shall always have them
But I should rather live with you for ever
Than exchange my troubles for a changeless kingdom.
But I do not put you on a pedestal or a throne;
You must have your faults but I do not see them.
If it were with you, I should live for ever.",https://genius.com/Paul-durcan-the-difficulty-that-is-marriage-annotated
Who Are You And Whom Do You Love? by Bhanu Kapil,Bhanu Kapil,"The poem, Who Are You And Whom Do You Love?, is one of the “Twelve Questions,” that Bhanu Kapil asks through her book, The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers. Bhanu Kapil, the British-born Indian origin Writer, in her full-length book, combines the narratives of the travelogue. During her travel through the above-mentioned countries, she reaches the homes of people living there, and comes in contact with them to take their interviews, and tries to learn how they live there, and asks them “Twelver Questions”, which relate to their lives. Through her “Vertical Interrogation of Strangers”, Bhanu Kapil asks what happens when the outside world of the individual self is pierced, invaded and colonized and terrorized. This book consists of a series of prose poems, written on the basis of interviews had with Indian women living in India, England, and the United States. The book blends these different voices, all answering a series of twelve questions that are the titles of each piece.","A month from now. A week from now. Tomorrow. When he goes.

broke the river fence; four and a half thousand hummingbirds; a
dying man; a man who is about to knock on the door of a woman
with black eyes, to tell her that he loves her; the woman herself, who

Valentine by Owen Sheers,Owen Sheers,"Owen Sheers’ ‘Valentine’ uses flashbacks of specific memories to document the deteriorating relationship Sheers has with his lover. The poem spans three different memories from a trip the couple took to Paris. After each memory, there is an intersecting line that states ‘that will be one memory’. The poem is an intersection of the themes of relationships and memory, exploring one through the other.

The poem flips the typical power dynamics which Owen Sheers usually writes from, with the female character having more power within the poem.","The water torture of your heels
emptying before me down that Paris street,
evacuated as the channels of our hearts.

That will be one memory.

The swing of the tassels on your skirt
each step filling out the curve of your hip;
your wet lashes, the loss of everything we’d learnt.


That will be another.

Then later – holding each other on the hotel bed,
like a pair of sunken voyagers
who had thought themselves done for,

only to wake washed up on a shore,
uncertain in their exhaustion,
whether to laugh or weep.

That, my valentine, will be the one I’ll keep.",https://genius.com/Owen-sheers-valentine-annotated
Conrad Siever by Edgar Lee Masters,Edgar Lee Masters,"Conrad Siever' by Edgar Lee Masters presents the liveliness of the northern-spy apple tree and the impact of autumn on the surroundings. 'Conrad Siever' by Edgar Lee Masters is a poem based on the theme of autumn. Death and decay features from the beginning of the poem. The poet feels for the withering trees and rotting plants the farm has turned into a graveyard. But, the poet isn't sitting there. He sits under the northern-spy apple tree which still has its time. Winter is not far ahead. Then everything will be changed, even the poet's favorite apple tree. However, at last, the poet feels satisfied with the red apples that he can still enjoy at that time of the year and imagines those apples to be the “living epitaphs” of the northern-spy.","Not in that wasted garden
Where bodies are drawn into grass
That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens
That bear no fruit —
There where along the shaded walks
Vain sighs are heard,
And vainer dreams are dreamed
Of close communion with departed souls —
But here under the apple tree
I loved and watched and pruned
With gnarled hands
In the long, long years;
Here under the roots of this northern-spy
To move in the chemic change and circle of life,
Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,
And into the living epitaphs
Of redder apples!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45917/conrad-siever
One Hundred Love Sonnets: XVII by Pablo Neruda,Pablo Neruda,"'One Hundred Love Sonnets: XVII' by Pablo Neruda describes the love he feels and how it surpasses any previous definition of what love could be. In the first stanza, the speaker lists out a few things that his love is not like. These objects, a rose and a flaming arrow are traditional representatives of love. His emotions go far beyond the physical. They exist deeper and are present in the “shadow and the soul.” This makes it seem as if his emotions are forbidden or ephemeral. They cannot be pegged down to anything as trite as a rose. The next section describes how his love is going to exist, no matter what. It is like the love one would feel for a flower that is not blooming, existing needless of exterior beauty. In the final lines, the speaker gives up trying to define his love through metaphor. He admits that he loves this person, and that is that. There is no better way to put it.","I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz, or arrow of carnations that propagate fire: I love you as one loves certain obscure things, secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself, and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose from the earth lives dimly in my body.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where, I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you, so close that your hand upon my chest is mine, so close that your eyes close with my dreams.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49236/one-hundred-love-sonnets-xvii
Power by Audre Lorde,Audre Lorde,"Meaning of Power 'Power' by Audre Lorde is a graphic and impactful poem that takes on racism in the justice system, police brutality, and white supremacy. Within the text of 'Power' Lorde addresses the murder of Clifford Glover and the court was that did not bring justice for the child or his family. She speaks on her rage and how that rage is connected to the anger of all of those abused at the hands of white oppressors throughout time. The poet uses disturbing images of violence and death to strike at the heart of the rhetoric around whiteness and blackness. She also compares that rhetoric to the power that poetry has to do in the face of these injustices.","The difference between poetry and rhetoric
is being ready to kill
yourself
instead of your children.

I am trapped on a desert of raw gunshot wounds
and a dead child dragging his shattered black
face off the edge of my sleep
blood from his punctured cheeks and shoulders
is the only liquid for miles
and my stomach
churns at the imagined taste while
my mouth splits into dry lips
without loyalty or reason
thirsting for the wetness of his blood
as it sinks into the whiteness
of the desert where I am lost
without imagery or magic
trying to make power out of hatred and destruction
trying to heal my dying son with kisses
only the sun will bleach his bones quicker.

A policeman who shot down a ten year old in Queens
stood over the boy with his cop shoes in childish blood
and a voice said “Die you little motherfucker” and
there are tapes to prove it. At his trial
this policeman said in his own defense
“I didn't notice the size nor nothing else
only the color”. And
there are tapes to prove that, too.

Today that 37 year old white man
with 13 years of police forcing
was set free
by eleven white men who said they were satisfied
justice had been done
and one Black Woman who said
“They convinced me” meaning
they had dragged her 4'10'' black Woman's frame
over the hot coals
of four centuries of white male approval
until she let go
the first real power she ever had
and lined her own womb with cement
to make a graveyard for our children.

I have not been able to touch the destruction
within me.
But unless I learn to use
the difference between poetry and rhetoric
my power too will run corrupt as poisonous mold
or lie limp and useless as an unconnected wire
and one day I will take my teenaged plug
and connect it to the nearest socket
raping an 85 year old white woman
who is somebody's mother
and as I beat her senseless and set a torch to her bed
a greek chorus will be singing in 3/4 time

Reserve by Louise Imogen Guiney,Louise Imogen Guiney,"'Reserve' by Louise Imogen Guiney tells of a man's love for a listener to whom he has done some irreconcilable wrong. The speaker begins by stating her love and appreciation for an unknown listener. This listener has started to sever ties with someone that they both know. It does not become clear until the end of the poem, but the male figure in this piece (who is in need of forgiveness) is in a relationship with the listener. He has done something undefined to the intended listener and he/she has not been able to forgive him. The speaker takes on the role of mediator and asks that the listener recall his/her memories of the times they had in the past and find some way to forgive him for what he has done. She also reminds the listener of the love that he holds for her/him and the “plainness” of his feelings.","You that are dear, O you above the rest!
Forgive him his evasive moods and cold;
The absence that belied him oft of old,
The war upon sad speech, the desperate jest,
And pity’s wildest gush but half-confessed,
Forgive him! Let your gentle memories hold
Some written word once tender and once bold,
Or service done shamefacedly at best,
Whereby to judge him. All his days he spent,
Like one who with an angel wrestled well,
O’ermastering Love with show of light disdain;
And whatso’er your spirits underwent,
He, wounded for you, worked no miracle
To make his heart’s allegiance wholly plain.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46087/reserve
The Banyan City by Vihang Naik,Vihang Naik,"'The Banyan City' by Vihang Naik compares the state of a city and a banyan tree through parallel imagery, depicting them as weathered, yet durable. The poem begins with the speaker referring to a banyan tree and how hard it is to unroot it. The only way to get rid of it is to cut it down. This occurs later on in the text, but in the meantime, the language surrounding the tree is expanding to describe a specific city in India. It too is old, weathered, and becoming more and more dilapidated as time passes. Eventually, the tree is cut down, metaphorically alluding to the end of the city itself. But, the poem ends optimistically with the speaker describing rebirth and the possibilities of the future.","To unearth the roots
of a banyan
is never easy.
Chop or hack. The old banyan
with the roots spread
over a century.

This aged city,
facing the withered glory,
now wrinkled, cracked,
weather-beaten,
with dim eyes,

has stood the time.
The heavy breath,

breathing. A river turns
into a gutter. There is humming
of vehicles. The city mumbles.

You grapple for meaning
in the traffic of noises.

The old banyan

is no more. You can no longer click
that tree at the crossroad, combing
the National Highway number eight
when you enter Vadodara.

The roots won't die.
You witness rebirth

in the mould of stone. A sculpted ghost.",poemhunter.com/poem/the-banyan-city/
From the Garden by Anne Sexton,Anne Sexton,"From the Garden' by Anne Sexton expresses a speaker's desire to take some time alone in the quiet of the garden with her intended listener. The poem takes the reader through the speaker's need to separate her “beloved” from their words and thoughts. She encourages this person to come with her to the garden to see the lilies, the view, and quiet their words. They need quiet time and a few moments to contemplate one another and life itself.","Come, my beloved,

without nurses or clocks.

decorate the muddy halls.

and your bad words. Spit out
your words like stones!

Come eat my pleasant fruits.",https://wordsfortheyear.com/2020/04/11/from-the-garden-by-anne-sexton/
A Sourdough Story by Robert Service,Robert Service,"Historical Context 'A Sourdough Story' was initially published in Service's 1940 volume, Bar-Room Ballads, which was published after Service moved from country to country in Europe before finally arriving in California, in the United States, to settle for the remainder of World War Two. Although 'A Sourdough Story' was published several decades after Service left the Yukon for the final time, there is clear reference to his time there, beginning with the title of the poem. “Sourdough,” a kind of bread, was a term that began to be used to describe Alaskan and Yukon prospectors, the most experienced of whom began to carry bread starters to nourish them during the more difficult or distant areas searched through during the gold rush. So, a “sourdough story” is one told about a Klondike prospector, one of the many people Service would have met and befriended during his time in the Yukon. The biblical references throughout this poem are somewhat more numerous than the sourdough ones, though they are also as easy to follow. Saint Peter appears in this poem; historically, he was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus, and after Jesus' execution, became one of the forefront leaders of Christianity, making himself a significant aspect of the creation of the Christian Church, to a point where he is considered today to be its first Pope. The Christian Bible attributes a number of letters and writings to Peter, though there are many religious scholars who doubt the full extent of his authorship to the New Testament. Another important element of Peter's connection to Christianity is that he is seen as the “gatekeeper” to Heaven; tradition suggests that souls that pass away will be unable to enter Heaven unless Saint Peter allows them entry. This is based on an account of a conversation between Jesus and Peter recorded in the Book of Matthew in the Christian Bible. Peter's role in 'A Sourdough Story' reflects his position as Heaven's gatekeeper.","Hark to the Sourdough story, told at sixty below,
When the pipes are lit and we smoke and spit
Into the campfire glow.
Rugged are we and hoary, and statin' a general rule,
A genooine Sourdough story
Ain't no yarn for the Sunday School.
A Sourdough came to stake his claim in Heav'n one morning early.
Saint Peter cried: ""Who waits outside them gates so bright and pearly?""
""I'm recent dead,"" the Sourdough said, ""and crave to visit Hades,
Where haply pine some pals o' mine, includin' certain ladies.""
Said Peter: ""Go, you old Sourdough, from life so crooly riven;
And if ye fail to find their trail, we'll have a snoop round Heaven.""
He waved, and lo! that old Sourdough dropped down to Hell's red spaces;
But though 'twas hot he couldn't spot them old familiar faces.
The bedrock burned, and so he turned, and climbed with footsteps fleeter,
The stairway straight to Heaven's gate, and there, of course, was Peter.
""I cannot see my mates,"" sez he, ""among those damned forever.
I have a hunch some of the bunch in Heaven I'll discover.""
Said Peter: ""True; and this I'll do (since Sourdoughs are my failing)
You see them guys in Paradise, lined up against the railing -
As bald as coots, in birthday suits, with beards below the middle . . .
Well, I'll allow you in right now, if you can solve a riddle:
Among that gang of stiffs who hang and dodder round the portals,
Is one whose name is know to Fame; it's Adam, first of mortals.
For quiet's sake he makes a break from Eve, which is his Madame. . . .
Well, there's the gate; To crash it straight, just spy the guy that's Adam.""
The old Sourdough went down the row of greybeards ruminatin'
With optics dim they peered at him, and pressed agin the gratin'.
In every face he sought some trace of our ancestral father;
But though he stared, he soon despaired the faintest clue to gather.
Then suddenly he whooped with glee: ""Ha! Ha! an inspiration.""
And to and fro along the row he ran with animation.
To Peter, bold he cried: ""Behold, all told there are eleven.
Suppose I fix on Number Six; say Boy! How's that for Heaven?""
""By gosh! you win,"" said Pete. ""Step in. But tell me how you chose him.
They're like as pins; all might be twins. There's nothing to disclose him.""
The Sourdough said: ""'Twas hard; my head was seething with commotion.
I felt a dunce; then all at once I had a gorgeous notion.
I stooped and peered beneath each beard that drooped like fleece of mutton.
My search was crowned. . . . That bird I found; ain't got no belly button.""",https://www.best-poems.net/robert_w_service/a_sourdough_story.html
A Friend’s Greeting by Edgar Guest,Edgar Guest,"'A Friend's Greeting' by Edgar Guest is a heart-to-heart poem about a speaker who expresses his gratitude to a friend who is always there to help him and makes his life joyous. This piece begins with the speaker talking about what is the value of his friend in his life. According to him, he wants to be like his dearest friend who is always glad to help him. The speaker wants to be a meaningful part of his life by doing splendid things for him. All he has is his heart-warming poetic art that can paint his sky blue. When they traveled together, his friend's shoulder gave him comfort after being weary of the journey. That's why, on the eve of Christmas, his only wish is to be like his friend.","I'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me;
I'd like to be the help that you've been always glad to be;
I'd like to mean as much to you each minute of the day
As you have meant, old friend of mine, to me along the way.
I'd like to do the big things and the splendid things for you,
To brush the gray from out your skies and leave them only blue;
I'd like to say the kindly things that I so oft have heard,
And feel that I could rouse your soul the way that mine you've stirred.
I'd like to give you back the joy that you have given me,
Yet that were wishing you a need I hope will never be;
I'd like to make you feel as rich as I, who travel on
Undaunted in the darkest hours with you to lean upon.
I'm wishing at this Christmas time that I could but repay
A portion of the gladness that you've strewn along my way;
And could I have one wish this year, this only would it be:
I'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me.",https://www.yourdailypoem.com/listpoem.jsp?poem_id=1687
Remember Remember the 5th of November,Undefined Poet,"'Remember Remember the 5th of November' speaks on Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to blow up Parliament and kill the monarch. Fawkes' reputation has evolved, mostly due to the passage of time and the story's popularization within films like V for Vendetta. He's celebrated as a folk hero, someone willing to stand up against something he didn't believe in and martyred for it. Whether his current reputation is deserved, the day continues to be celebrated every November 5th.","Remember, remember, the 5th of November,
Gunpowder, treason and plot.
I see no reason
Why gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot.
Guy Fawkes, Guy Fawkes, 'twas his intent
To blow up the King and the Parliament
Three score barrels of powder below
Poor old England to overthrow
By God's providence he was catch'd
With a dark lantern and burning match
Holler boys, holler boys, let the bells ring
Holler boys, holler boys
God save the King!",https://wordsforlife.org.uk/activities/remember-remember-the-5th-of-november/
Old Ironsides by Oliver Wendell Holmes,Oliver Wendell Holmes,"Old Ironsides' by Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks on the glory of the USS Constitution on the eve of its decommissioning. The poem begins with the speaker agreeing that the ship should be decommissioned. He asks that the “ensign” be torn down and eventually nailed to the mast of the ship. The Constitution has sailed for too long and seen too much. It is time for the battles of the past to be put to rest and for the ship to find a grave on the bottom of the sea. While the speaker's words seem passionate, it is clear the poet has the opposite goal in mind. He is actually, through the honouring of the ship, campaigning for its preservation and continuation in the service. By the end of the piece, a reader should come to the same conclusion; that the ship's history is too important to ignore and that it must be allowed to remain on the sea.","Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!
Long has it waved on high,
And many an eye has danced to see
That banner in the sky;
Beneath it rung the battle shout,
And burst the cannon’s roar;—
The meteor of the ocean air
Shall sweep the clouds no more!
Her deck, once red with heroes’ blood
Where knelt the vanquished foe,
When winds were hurrying o’er the flood
And waves were white below,
No more shall feel the victor’s tread,
Or know the conquered knee;—
The harpies of the shore shall pluck
The eagle of the sea!
O, better that her shattered hulk
Should sink beneath the wave;
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,
And there should be her grave;
Nail to the mast her holy flag,
Set every thread-bare sail,
And give her to the god of storms,—
The lightning and the gale!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46547/old-ironsides
Here by Philip Larkin,Philip Larkin,"‘Here‘ by Philip Larkin captures the evolving journey of the poet’s emotional connection to his surroundings. Progressing from urban shadows and bustling towns to isolated landscapes, the poem illustrates the poet’s evolving perception of places and belongingness. In the poem ‘Here,’ Philip Larkin, the poet embarks on a very detailed exploration of shifting landscapes and the emotional fervor they evoke. The poem begins amidst the urban hustle and industrial shadows before steering eastward to meager fields and solitary spaces. As dawn breaks, the scene transforms into a quaint town, where domes, statues, and barges intermingle with bustling streets. This town stands as a curious blend of simplicity and urbanity, where residents pursue their desires amidst the hum of commerce. Larkin’s skillful imagery captures the essence of a world in transition, where loneliness finds its voice amidst hidden beauty. As the poem, ‘Here‘ progresses, the urban ambiance gives way to an isolated existence. The verses reflect the tranquility that resides in these quieter surroundings — neglected waters coming to life, the air that was weighed down by so many people lifting up, and distant landscapes yielding to the sun’s embrace. Yet, even in this solitude, a stark sense of hope prevails. The imagery of an unfenced existence facing the unreachable sun encapsulates the unspoken distance between the self and the external world. Through its expertly crafted scenes and lyrical language, ‘Here’ becomes a poignant meditation on the interplay between changing landscapes, inner contemplation, and the perennial quest for connection.","Swerving east, from rich industrial shadows
And traffic all night north; swerving through fields
Too thin and thistled to be called meadows,
And now and then a harsh—named halt, that shields
Workmen at dawn; swerving to solitude
Of skies and scarecrows, haystacks, hares and pheasants,
And the widening river’s slow presence,
The piled gold clouds, the shining gull—marked mud,
 
Gathers to the surprise of a large town:
Here domes and statues, spires and cranes cluster
Beside grain—scattered streets, barge—crowded water,
And residents from raw estates, brought down
The dead straight miles by stealing flat—faced trolleys,
Push through plate—glass swing doors to their desires —
Cheap suits, red kitchen—ware, sharp shoes, iced lollies,
Electric mixers, toasters, washers, driers—
 
A cut—price crowd, urban yet simple, dwelling
Where only salesmen and relations come
Within a terminate and fishy—smelling
Pastoral of ships up streets, the slave museum,
Tattoo—shops, consulates, grim head—scarfed wives;
And out beyond its mortgaged half—built edges
Fast—shadowed wheat—fields, running high as hedges,
Isolate villages, where removed lives
 
Loneliness clarifies. Here silence stands
Like heat. Here leaves unnoticed thicken,
Hidden weeds flower, neglected waters quicken,
Luminously—peopled air ascends;
And past the poppies bluish neutral distance
Ends the land suddenly beyond a beach
Of shapes and shingle. Here is unfenced existence:
Facing the sun, untalkative, out of reach.",https://www.poeticous.com/philip-larkin/here
Old Song by Edward FitzGerald,Edward FitzGerald,"Old Song' by Edward FitzGerald describes a speaker depression over the long weeks of winter, and eventual joy over the coming spring. The poem begins with the speaker giving a brief description of the world outside his window. It is not something he wants to dwell on and only gives the reader enough detail for them to know it is winter, and the wind is blowing drearily. He decides to retreat to his room, by the fireplace, until the season is over. There is meets with a friend, reminisces on the past, drinks, smokes, and prays until finally summer returns. At the moment warmth enters back into the world the speaker runs like “mad” out into the meadows he has so desperately missed.","TIS a dull sight
To see the year dying,
When winter winds
Set the yellow wood sighing:
Sighing, O sighing!
When such a time cometh
I do retire
Into an old room
Beside a bright fire:
O, pile a bright fire!
And there I sit
Reading old things,
Of knights and lorn damsels,
While the wind sings—
O, drearily sings!
I never look out
Nor attend to the blast;
For all to be seen
Is the leaves falling fast:
Falling, falling!
But close at the hearth,
Like a cricket, sit I,
Reading of summer
And chivalry—
Gallant chivalry!
Then with an old friend
I talk of our youth—
How 'twas gladsome, but often
Foolish, forsooth:
But gladsome, gladsome!
Or, to get merry,
We sing some old rhyme
That made the wood ring again
In summer time—
Sweet summer time!
Then go we smoking,
Silent and snug:
Naught passes between us,
Save a brown jug—
Sometimes!
And sometimes a tear
Will rise in each eye,
Seeing the two old friends
So merrily—
So merrily!
And ere to bed
Go we, go we,
Down on the ashes
We kneel on the knee,
Praying together!
Thus, then, live I
Till, 'mid all the gloom,
By Heaven! the bold sun
Is with me in the room
Shining, shining!
Then the clouds part,
Swallows soaring between;
The spring is alive,
And the meadows are green!
I jump up like mad,
Break the old pipe in twain,
And away to the meadows,
The meadows again!",https://englishverse.com/poems/old_song
Resignation by Nikki Giovanni,Nikki Giovanni,"'Resignation' by Nikki Giovanni quantifies her love for her child. While it could simply be about a lover, I argue that the unconscious pull of love 'determined' suggests a motherly bond. The poem begins with 'I love you', and continues by examining why she has this emotion. The first stanza focuses on the 'natural order of things', the seasons and weather all flowing just because they must – a comparison Giovanni draws to her state of love. The second stanza focuses on the habits Giovanni has built throughout her life, with love slipping into her life and staying. The third stanza focuses on how happy Giovanni is to be in love, idolising her child's voice and how their presence makes her feel. The fourth stanza explores the safety a relationship provides, Giovanni enjoying waking up and finding her child there in the morning. The final stanza discusses how they met, with the baby seeing Giovanni and 'decided that I [Giovanni] would love you', relating to the natural order of loving your child, and how Giovanni's whole life has changed because of it.","I love you
because the Earth turns round the sun
because the North wind blows north
sometimes
because the Pope is Catholic
and most Rabbis Jewish
because the winters flow into springs
and the air clears after a storm
because only my love for you
despite the charms of gravity
keeps me from falling off this Earth
into another dimension
I love you
because it is the natural order of things
I love you
like the habit I picked up in college
of sleeping through lectures
or saying I’m sorry
when I get stopped for speeding
because I drink a glass of water
in the morning
and chain-smoke cigarettes
all through the day
because I take my coffee Black
and my milk with chocolate
because you keep my feet warm
though my life a mess
I love you
because I don’t want it
any other way
I am helpless
in my love for you
It makes me so happy
to hear you call my name
I am amazed you can resist
locking me in an echo chamber
where your voice reverberates
through the four walls
sending me into spasmatic ecstasy
I love you
because it’s been so good
for so long
that if I didn’t love you
I’d have to be born again
and that is not a theological statement
I am pitiful in my love for you
The Dells tell me Love
is so simple
the thought though of you
sends indescribably delicious multitudinous
thrills throughout and through-in my body
I love you
because no two snowflakes are alike
and it is possible
if you stand tippy-toe
to walk between the raindrops
I love you
because I am afraid of the dark
and can’t sleep in the light
because I rub my eyes
when I wake up in the morning
and find you there
because you with all your magic powers were
determined that
I should love you
because there was nothing for you but that
I would love you
I love you
because you made me
want to love you
more than I love my privacy
my freedom my commitments
and responsibilities
I love you ’cause I changed my life
to love you
because you saw me one Friday
afternoon and decided that I would
love you
I love you I love you I love you",https://poets.org/poem/resignation
First Death in Nova Scotia by Elizabeth Bishop,Elizabeth Bishop,"'First Death in Nova Scotia' is told from the perspective of a young child who is experiencing death for the first time. Her mother has brought her to see the body of her recently deceased cousin. She observes the portraits of royalty hanging around the body and speculates that they have called him to you to be the youngest page in court. Also near the body stands a stuffed loon, sitting on a “marble-topped table.” The speaker describes how the body appears, how he was “all white, like a doll” and “Jack Frost had started to paint him.” At the conclusion of the poem the speaker expresses concern over how Arthur will make it to court with the royals with his “eyes shut up so tight.”","In the cold, cold parlor
my mother laid out Arthur
beneath the chromographs:
Edward, Prince of Wales,
with Princess Alexandra,
and King George with Queen Mary.
Below them on the table
stood a stuffed loon
shot and stuffed by Uncle
Arthur, Arthur's father.
Since Uncle Arthur fired
a bullet into him,
he hadn't said a word.
He kept his own counsel
on his white, frozen lake,
the marble-topped table.
His breast was deep and white,
cold and caressable;
his eyes were red glass,
much to be desired.
""Come,"" said my mother,
""Come and say good-bye
to your little cousin Arthur.""
I was lifted up and given
one lily of the valley
to put in Arthur's hand.
Arthur's coffin was
a little frosted cake,
and the red-eyed loon eyed it
from his white, frozen lake.
Arthur was very small.
He was all white, like a doll
that hadn't been painted yet.
Jack Frost had started to paint him
the way he always painted
the Maple Leaf (Forever).
He had just begun on his hair,
a few red strokes, and then
Jack Frost had dropped the brush
and left him white, forever.
The gracious royal couples
were warm in red and ermine;
their feet were well wrapped up
in the ladies' ermine trains.
They invited Arthur to be
the smallest page at court.
But how could Arthur go,
clutching his tiny lily,
with his eyes shut up so tight
and the roads deep in snow?",https://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php%3Fdate=2003%252F02%252F08.html
The Lamb by William Blake,William Blake,"‘The Lamb’ by William Blake is a warm and curious poem that uses the lamb as a symbol for Christ, innocence, and the nature of God’s creation. The lamb is a universal symbol of selfless innocence, Jesus the Lamb is the gentle imagination, the Divine Humanity. The Lamb identifies with Christ to form a Trinity of child, Lamb, and Redeemer. Throughout the two stanzas of this poem, the poet speaks to the lamb, asking it if it knows who was responsible for creating it. He goes into vague detail about Christ, his nature, while using repetition to emphasize these features.","Little Lamb who made thee
Dost thou know who made thee
Gave thee life & bid thee feed.
By the stream & o'er the mead;
Gave thee clothing of delight,
Softest clothing wooly bright;
Gave thee such a tender voice,
Making all the vales rejoice!
Little Lamb who made thee
Dost thou know who made thee

Little Lamb I'll tell thee,
Little Lamb I'll tell thee!
He is called by thy name,
For he calls himself a Lamb:
He is meek & he is mild,
He became a little child:
I a child & thou a lamb,
We are called by his name.
Little Lamb God bless thee.
Little Lamb God bless thee.",https://poemanalysis.com/william-blake/the-lamb/
Allegory of the Cave by Stephen Dunn,Stephen Dunn,"'Allegory of the Cave' by Stephen Dunn describes a cave dweller's search for the “real” and his reaction after encountering the harsh reality. This piece directly begins with the episode where one of the cave dwellers (in Plato's allegory, the philosopher or the greatest individual) attempts to break the shackles of darkness and face the sun or the light of knowledge. The piercing light not only blinds his eyes but also teaches him something greater than he previously believed in. Besides, he learns the ravages of history and where the world is leading. When he tries to communicate the message to other dwellers, they find it quite unbelievable and false. It makes him question even the reality around him.","He climbed toward the blinding light
and when his eyes adjusted
he looked down and could see

his fellow prisoners captivated
by shadows; everything he had believed
was false. And he was suddenly

in the 20th century, in the sunlight
and violence of history, encumbered
by knowledge. Only a hero

would dare return with the truth.
So from the cave's upper reaches,
removed from harm, he called out

the disturbing news.
What lovely echoes, the prisoners said,
what a fine musical place to live.

He spelled it out, then, in clear prose
on paper scraps, which he floated down.
But in the semi-dark they read his words

with the indulgence of those who seldom read:
It's about my father's death, one of them said.
No, said the others, it's a joke.

By this time he no longer was sure
of what he'd seen. Wasn't sunlight a shadow too?
Wasn't there always a source

behind a source? He just stood there,
confused, a man who had moved
to larger errors, without a prayer.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/11874157-Allegory-Of-The-Cave-by-Stephen-Dunn
The Creation by James Weldon Johnson,James Weldon Johnson,"'The Creation' by James Weldon Johnson is a retelling of the story of Genesis. This poem depicts a human-like image of God, the man behind the creation. This poem starts with a sense of continuity. According to the poet, God might have felt lonely. For this reason, he created the earth. But, he was not satisfied until he made humans. In the body of the poem, readers can find how God made this creation bit by bit. Firstly, he brought light into the world by creating, sun, moon, and stars. Thereafter he cooled the temperature of the earth by creating rain and made several creatures fill the space with the spontaneity of life. After this long process, he thought he would be happy. But, he was not. Hence, he created humans from the “lump of clay.”","And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said: That's good!
Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,
And God rolled the light around in his hands
Until he made the sun;
And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said: That's good!
Then God himself stepped down—
And the sun was on his right hand,
And the moon was on his left;
The stars were clustered about his head,
And the earth was under his feet.
And God walked, and where he trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then he stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And he spat out the seven seas—
He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed—
He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled—
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around his shoulder.
Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!
And quicker than God could drop his hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said: That's good!
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that he had made.
He looked at his sun,
And he looked at his moon,
And he looked at his little stars;
He looked on his world
With all its living things,
And God said: I'm lonely still.
Then God sat down—
On the side of a hill where he could think;
By a deep, wide river he sat down;
With his head in his hands,
God thought and thought,
Till he thought: I'll make me a man!
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;
This great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till he shaped it in is his own image;
Then into it he blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen. Amen.",https://poets.org/poem/creation
The Nymph’s Reply to the Shepherd by Sir Walter Raleigh,Sir Walter Raleigh ,"'The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd' by Sir Walter Raleigh is filled with pastoral images that contain a negative response to the shepherd's plea. Throughout this poem, the nymph describes how time, pleasure, and all possessions, are fleeting. These joys won't last forever, nor will impetuous choices and sweet words. All of these things are like “spring” to “fall”. They might be beautiful now but when it comes time for the season to change they are going to fade like everything else.","If all the world and love were young,
And truth in every Shepherd’s tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move,
To live with thee, and be thy love.

Time drives the flocks from field to fold,
When Rivers rage and Rocks grow cold,
And Philomel becometh dumb,
The rest complains of cares to come.

The flowers do fade, and wanton fields,
To wayward winter reckoning yields,
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,
Is fancy’s spring, but sorrow’s fall.

Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of Roses,
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies
Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten:
In folly ripe, in reason rotten.

Thy belt of straw and Ivy buds,
The Coral clasps and amber studs,
All these in me no means can move
To come to thee and be thy love.

But could youth last, and love still breed,
Had joys no date, nor age no need,
Then these delights my mind might move
To live with thee, and be thy love.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44939/the-nymphs-reply-to-the-shepherd
A Character by William Wordsworth,William Wordsworth,"'A Character' by William Wordsworth speaks on the moral character of a segment of mankind in relation to the feelings he has for the intended listener. The poem begins with the speaker stating that “Nature” has found a way to imbue the face of “man” with an endless array of emotions. He is able to read these emotions and sees them as being both contrasting and complementary. The speaker points out “thought and no thought” as well as “pleasure and gloom.” In the following lines, the speaker moves from describing all of humanity to a small portion he calls “man.” This word ends up standing in for a particular type of man he fears will run away with his listener's heart. It is his goal with this piece to expose the flaws in their moral character and steer her away from them and towards him.","I marvel how Nature could ever find space
For so many strange contrasts in one human face:
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.

There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;
Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain
Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,
Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease.

There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,
And attention full ten times as much as there needs;
Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;
And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.

There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare
Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,
There's virtue, the title it surely may claim,
Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.

This picture from nature may seem to depart,
Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart;
And I for five centuries right gladly would be
Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.",poemhunter.com/poem/a-character/
My Grandmother by Elizabeth Jennings,Elizabeth Jennings,"'My Grandmother' by Elizabeth Jennings is a powerful poem that explores a speaker's relationship with her grandmother. The poem begins with the speaker describing the antique shop that her grandmother used to have. In the shop, she would collect and polish items that the speaker found a little value in. The speaker also recalls a time when her grandmother invited her out on a shopping trip, something that she refused. To this day, she still feels guilt over this refusal. Eventually, the grandmother becomes too frail to care for her shop and has to close it. She moves a few items she's able to into a narrow room in her home. She dies, and the speaker is left walking through her possessions and considering her grandmother's life.","She kept an antique shop – or it kept her.
Among Apostle spoons and Bristol glass,
The faded silks, the heavy furniture,
She watched her own reflection in the brass
Salvers and silver bowls, as if to prove
Polish was all, there was no need of love.
And I remember how I once refused
To go out with her, since I was afraid.
It was perhaps a wish not to be used
Like antique objects. Though she never said
That she was hurt, I still could feel the guilt
Of that refusal, guessing how she felt.

Later, too frail to keep a shop, she put
All her best things in one narrow room.
The place smelt old, of things too long kept shut,
The smell of absences where shadows come
That can’t be polished. There was nothing then
To give her own reflection back again.

And when she died I felt no grief at all,
Only the guilt of what I once refused.
I walked into her room among the tall
Sideboards and cupboards – things she never used
But needed; and no finger marks were there,
Only the new dust falling through the air.",http://holyjoe.org/poetry/jennings.htm
To Night by Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"To Night Analysis Swiftly walk o'er the western wave, Spirit of Night! Out of the misty eastern cave, Where, all the long and lone daylight, Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear, Which make thee terrible and dear,— Swift be thy flight! The poet here makes an appeal to Night which has been personified. Night seems to the poet to be a living being, capable of acting in accordance with its own will and capable of listening to the poet. Shelly has, therefore, created a myth here. He appeals to Night to spread itself over the western sky where the sun sets. He imagines that Night spends the hours of daylight in some misty eastern cave, all alone, and that it keeps busy during that time, manufacturing or weaving dreams of joy and fear for human beings. These dreams are seen by human beings during their sleep. Sweet dreams, which human beings see, make Night dear to them; but the frightening dreams, which they see, make Night terrible to them. Thus, human beings are in love with Night and yet, at the same time, they are afraid of Night. The poet is in love with Night without being afraid of it. He wants Night to come swiftly and without delay. Wrap thy form in a mantle gray, Star-inwrought! The poet calls upon Night to wrap itself in a gray-colored cloak which has stars woven in its texture. The dark sky is regarded here as the mantle of Night and the stars that shine in the sky are supposed to be woven in the texture of that mantle. Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day; Kiss her until she be wearied out, Here Day is also personified. The poet asks Night to come and spread its black hair over the eyes of Day, so that Day may no longer be able to see. Then the poet asks Night to overwhelm Day with kisses. Let Day be kissed so vehemently and repeatedly that Day feels tired of these kisses and flees from the world. This is a poetic fancy. What the poet means is that, with the coming of Night, Day withdraws from this world. Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land, Touching all with thine opiate wand— Come, long-sought! We are to imagine that Night carries in its hand magic staffs, which has the power of sending everyone, who is touched with it, to sleep. When Night comes, all creatures fall asleep. When I arose and saw the dawn, I sighed for thee; When light rode high, and the dew was gone, And noon lay heavy on flower and tree, And the weary Day turned to his rest, Lingering like an unloved guest. I sighed for thee. When Day was tired of its stay on the earth, it felt like resting. And yet Day stayed on for some time more, just as a guest might prolong his stay in a house where he is no longer welcome. Here is the use of simile (Lingering like an unloved guest) is made very appropriately. Thy brother Death came, and cried, Wouldst thou me? Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed, Murmured like a noontide bee, Shall I nestle near thy side? Wouldst thou me?—And I replied, No, not thee! The poet is interested neither in Death nor in Sleep. He looks upon Death as the brother of Night, and he calls Sleep a child of Night. Death is also the brother of Night because Night stands for darkness, and Death takes human beings into the unknown dark region. Sleep is the child of Night because it is during night that human beings are overcome by Sleep. Both Death and Sleep offer to come to him. Death is prepared to take him away from this world in case he is sick of life. Sleep, which makes the eyelids close, speaks to the poet every sweetly and softly like the murmuring of a bee at noon-time. Sleep offers to creep close to the poet and to send him into a state of temporary forgetfulness. But the poet rejects both these offers, because he is attracted only by Night. Death will come when thou art dead, Soon, too soon— Sleep will come when thou art fled; Of neither would I ask the boon I ask of thee, belovèd Night— Swift be thine approaching flight, Come soon, soon! Death would come to the poet in its own time. It would not take long in coming to the poet. (Here is an unconscious prophecy of Shelley's premature death. It was at the age of 29 that he was drowned in the sea). The poet does not accept the offer of Sleep, because Sleep can come to him when Night is gone. He would not like to waste his time in sleeping. He can sleep permanently after death.","Swiftly walk o'er the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear,—
Swift be thy flight!
Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o'er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand—
Come, long-sought!
When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary Day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest.
I sighed for thee.
Thy brother Death came, and cried,
Wouldst thou me?
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee,
Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?—And I replied,
No, not thee!
Death will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon—
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, belovèd Night—
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45147/to-night
My God! O Let Me Call Thee Mine! by Anne Brontë,Anne Brontë,"'My God! O Let Me Call Thee Mine!' by Anne Brontë is a spiritual poem portraying a person's ultimate desire to please God, despite their little faith and great fears. 'My God! O Let Me Call Thee Mine!' kicks off with the persona's passionate cry to God. The poet persona asks that they and God belong to each other as lovers do. The speaker goes on to outline reasons they are undeserving of God—those reasons being their weak faith, dark pasts, sinful nature, and anxiety about the future. Nonetheless, their request remains because they believe God's presence in their life can fix those issues. As the poem progresses, the speaker alternates these two “prayer points”: reverencing God than asking He relieves them of their worries. The persona concludes with a final request that God makes them live in a way that pleases Him, not themselves. Although the speaker says their faith is weak, they, no doubt, believe firmly in God. Their anxiety about the future and grief from the past challenge their faith throughout the poem. However, that faith persists, as seen in the speaker's tone and mood at the poem's conclusion.","My God! O let me call Thee mine!
Weak wretched sinner though I be,
My trembling soul would fain be Thine,
My feeble faith still clings to Thee,
My feeble faith still clings to Thee.
Not only for the past I grieve,
The future fills me with dismay;
Unless Thou hasten to relieve,
I know my heart will fall away,
I know my heart will fall away.

I cannot say my faith is strong,
I dare not hope my love is great;
But strength and love to Thee belong,
O, do not leave me desolate!
O, do not leave me desolate!

I know I owe my all to Thee,
O, take this heart I cannot give.
Do Thou my Strength my Saviour be;
And make me to Thy glory live!
And make me to Thy glory live!",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/My_God!_O_let_me_call_Thee_mine!
The Trouble With Geraniums by Mervyn Peake,Mervyn Peake,"'The Trouble With Geraniums' by Mervyn Peake is a humorous poem with a poignant message about self-perception. The poem takes the reader through several amusing statements about the nature of very basic things. These include flowers, bread, and stars. He asserts that he is troubled by their nature. They are too red, too full of bread, and too bright. The obvious humour in these lines is made meaningful in the last stanza when he describes the trouble he has with himself. This is where the reader comes to understand the main themes of this piece and their commentary on one's opinion of one's self.","The trouble with geraniums
is that they’re much too red!
The trouble with my toast is that
it’s far too full of bread.

The trouble with a diamond
is that it’s much too bright.
The same applies to fish and stars
and the electric light.

The troubles with the stars I see
lies in the way they fly.
The trouble with myself is all
self-centred in the eye.

The trouble with my looking-glass
is that it shows me, me;
there’s trouble in all sorts of things
where it should never be.",https://fromtroublesofthisworld.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/the-trouble-with-geraniums-by-mervyn-peake/
The Veteran by Margaret Postgate Cole,Margaret Postgate Cole,"In the first lines of ‘The Veteran,’ the speaker begins by making straightforward statements about the man she encountered sitting in the sun. He was alone and blinded by war. There are no details about who he was, where he fought, or what happened that made him lose his eyes. A few young soldiers came up to him and asked for his advice. He gave it, sharing something of the horrors he encountered. 

At the end of ‘The Veteran’ Cole surprises the reader by revealing, through the veteran’s words, that he is only eighteen. It’s only after concluding the poem that a reader can assess the themes. They include age, experience, and of course, war.","We came upon him sitting in the sun
Blinded by war, and left. And past the fence
There came young soldiers from the Hand and Flower,
Asking advice of his experience.
And he said this, and that, and told them tales,
And all the nightmares of each empty head
Blew into air; then, hearing us beside,
""Poor chaps, how'd they know what it's like?"" he said.
And we stood there, and watched him as he sat,
Turning his sockets where they went away,
Until it came to one of us to ask ""And you're-how old?""
""Nineteen, the third of May.""",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8573285-The-Veteran-by-Margaret-Postgate-Cole
Sonnet 108 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'Sonnet 108' by William Shakespeare depicts the speaker's love for the Fair Youth as unchanging, despite the ravages of old age. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker asks several rhetorical questions in regard to how much more there is for him to write about his love. He's written so much and knows that he's touched on every possible subject. Despite this, he isn't bored. He continues to write, taking just as much pleasure from the process as ever. He and his lover, the Fair Youth, belong to one another in the same way they did when their love was young. He intends for that to remain the same as they both age, and outward appearances suggest that their love should be “dead.”","What’s in the brain, that ink may character,
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
What’s new to speak, what now to register,
That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
I must each day say o’er the very same;
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
So that eternal love in love’s fresh case,
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
But makes antiquity for aye his page;
Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
Where time and outward form would show it dead.",https://nosweatshakespeare.com/sonnets/108/
The Rainbow Bridge,Paul C. Dahm,"The Rainbow Bridge' is a beautiful, uplifting poem that is dedicated to those who have lost their pets and are looking for solace. Throughout this poem, the poet, whoever they may be, lays out the joyous afterlife that a pet has in store. They are going to leave the world of the living and go to reside in a warm, fertile field where they'll wait for their owners to arrive. After, they will cross over the metaphorical rainbow bridge into heaven together.","Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals that had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together…",https://fourleggedlove.wordpress.com/rainbow-bridge/
Song of the Women of my Land by Oumar Farouk,Oumar Farouk,"'Song of the Women of my Land' by Oumar Farouk depicts a terrible past through the eyes of a poet who is tapping into a tune once sung in his land. The poem begins with the poet utilizing similes and metaphors to speak on the way that time is able to chip away at memory and experiences. It has done its job on the “memory” of the women of his land, Sierra Leone, and now it is stripping away the “lyrics of the song” they used to sing. In the past, their individual experiences came together to form a unifying, uplifting tune that helped them fight back emotionally and mentally against the oppression and slavery they were enduring. Time has taken its toll though, and the song is slowly being lost to the ages, just as these women were. Now, all that's left is a tune that, through personification, is able to wander the “forlorn fields”. It searches out someone who might hear and appreciate it. Luckily, it appears that some do. It is there as inspiration for poets to write new songs based around its sound, just as Farouk wrote this one.","Like a sculptor chipping away at bits of wood,
Time chisels away bits of their memory
It strips away lyrics of the women of my Land
Leaving only a fading tune echoing the song,
they sang in the forlorn fields
about their lives; songs
of how they ploughed the terrain of their landscape
for memories of lyrics lost in the vast void of time,
in those days when a song beheld their lives;
when servitude cuffed the ankles of their soul,
and dereliction decapitated the epic of their lives.
With a song, they sponged off their anguish,
to behold their collective pain,
to celebrate their gains,
give lyrics to the tune of their lives,
cheat the tyranny of tit
and commune with the yet unborn
to give meaning to an epoch lost in antiquity,
Yet time strips the lyrics and scars the tune,
leaving a dying song.
The Song of the Women of my Land by Oumar Farouk Sesay
Dead!
Like the woman who died long ago,
Leaving the song to tell the story of their lives.
Today the tune roams the forlorn fields
Like their souls looking for lyrics.
To tell the tale of servitude
of the women of my Land
Who ploughed their soil and soul
For a song to sing the story of their lives
The song of the women of my Land
left in the memory of my mind.
Now feeding the verses of poets, it echoes in
Wriggling in the rhythms and melodies,
Hollering in distant tunes
In places far afield the forlorn fields,
where the song of their lives died.
The stuttering lips of my pen
And the screeching voice of my rib
try to sing the song of the women of my Land
In verses far from the theatre of toil
where they left a song that now roams the land
stripped of lyrics like a scorned ghost.
The tune tuning the tenor of my verse
is all that remains of the song of the women of my land
Who laboured and died leaving a dying song.
The dirge of their lives!",https://kisswriters.com/the-song-of-the-women-of-my-land-by-oumar-farouk-sesay/
The Apple-Raid by Vernon Scannell,Vernon Scannell,"'The Apple-Raid' by Vernon Scannell describes how the poet along with his friends John Peters and David Kidd stealthily entered into the gardens to collect apples during Autumn. This piece begins with a reference to the external ambiance. It was the season of autumn. The speaker of this poem recalls how the breeze spiced with garden fires, the smell of burnt leaves, and the early dark excited him when he was a child. Then he gathered in the park with his friends John and David. The kids went out of town to the district where wealthy families lived. They went there to collect apples in the secret dark. After gathering apples, they stepped outside silently as they entered and moved out of town munching their raided items. Now David is fifty and his childish spirit has dimmed. In the case of John, he is no more. Ironically, his grave can be found in a French orchard beneath apple boughs.","Darkness came early, though not yet cold;
Stars were strung on the telegraph wires;
Street lamps spilled pools of liquid gold;
The breeze was spiced with garden fires.
That smell of burnt leaves, the early dark.
Can still excite me but not as it did
So long ago when we met in the park-
Myself, John Peters and David Kidd.
We moved out of town to the district where
The lucky and wealthy had their homes
with garages, gardens and apples to spare
Clustered in the trees' green domes
We chose the place we meant to plunder
And climbed the wall and tip-toed through
The secret dark. Apples crunched under Our feet as we moved through the grass and dew.
We found the lower boughs of a tree
That were easy to reach. We stored the fruit
in pockets and jerseys until all three
Boys were heavy with their tasty loot.
Safe on the other side of the wall
We moved back to town and munched as we went.
I wonder if David remembers at all That little adventure, the apples' fresh scent?
Strange to think that he's fifty years old,
That though little boy with scabs on his knees;
Stranger to think that John Pieters lies cold
In an orchard in France beneath apple trees.",https://sites.google.com/site/englishportfoliorlo/my-poems
My Heart Leaps Up by William Wordsworth,William Wordsworth,"'My Heart Leaps Up' by William Wordsworth centers on a rainbow, a symbol of nature and how the poet wishes to keep his childlike self alive. This poem begins with a reference to a rainbow. Whenever Wordsworth beholds it, his heart gets filled with enthusiasm and energy. It is not that the sensation of joy existed in his heart when he was a child. As an adult, he still enjoys the beauty of a rainbow. He wishes to retain this childish self even if he matures and grows old. If it does not happen, he will embrace death unquestionably. According to him, nature, symbolized by the rainbow, will always be divine, and he thinks it should be for everyone.","My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.",https://poets.org/poem/my-heart-leaps
But You Didn’t by Merrill Glass,Merrill Glass,"But You Didn't' by Merrill Glass describes the relationship of the poet and husband and the many things she did not get to tell him. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she got into a car accident. She feared that her partner would be furious with her for what happened, but that was not the case. He surprised her with his kind reaction. The same formula plays out over the following stanzas as the speaker presents a memory of a mistake she made and the pleasantly measured reaction she got from her husband. It is in the fourth stanza that the true nature of the poem is revealed. She is not bringing these memories back to the forefront for sentimental reasons or to make some grand gesture, but as a kind of catharsis. Glass informs the reader that her husband died, having not returned from Vietnam. This means she was never able to acknowledge all that he did for her.","Remember the time you lent me your car and I dented it?
I thought you'd kill me...
But you didn't.
Remember the time I forgot to tell you the dance was
formal, and you came in jeans?
I thought you'd hate me...
But you didn't.
Remember the times I'd flirt with
other boys just to make you jealous, and
you were?
I thought you'd drop me...
But you didn't.
There were plenty of things you did to put up with me,
to keep me happy, to love me, and there are
so many things I wanted to tell
you when you returned from
Vietnam...
But you didn't.",https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/but-you-didnt-by-merrill-glass
Listen to the MUSTN’TS by Shel Silverstein,Shel Silverstein,"'Listen to the MUSTN'TS' by Shel Silverstein describes all the negativity a child will face in their life and encourages them to ignore these voices. The poem begins with the speaker telling the child that they must take the time to listen to all the naysayers in the world. There are the “MUSTN'TS” and the “DONT'S” as well as the “WONT'S.” All of these people will tell the child that what they want can't and should not occur. The child needs to hear them, and then push their voices aside so they can get on with making everything they want to happen.","Listen to Mustn'ts, child, listen to the Don'ts.
Listen to the Shouldn'ts, the Impossibles, the Won'ts.
Listen to the Never Haves, then listen close to me.

Winter Trees by William Carlos Williams,William Carlos Williams,"Winter Trees' by William Carlos Williams explores the gaining and losing of leaves, watching trees as they enter their yearly slumber. Williams is fascinated by this process, drawing similarities with the human practice of putting on and taking off clothes. The use of personification throughout the poem gives Winter Trees a friendly and comforting sense. The excitement present in Williams' writing makes it appear as if he is friends with the trees, happy to watch them grow and change. The poem ends with the trees going to sleep, ready to pass through the winter. ","All the complicated details
of the attiring and
the disattiring are completed!
A liquid moon
moves gently among
the long branches.
Thus having prepared their buds
against a sure winter
the wise trees
stand sleeping in the cold.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45504/winter-trees
September 1913 by William Butler Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"'September 1913' by William Butler Yeats is a mournful elegy for “Romantic Ireland” and the nationalist heroes that Yeats admired. The poem takes the reader through Yeats' perception of the current state of Irish politics and the beliefs of the general public. He feels disdain towards those who have no regard for the past and don't remember what was lost. Yeats thinks that all the strength of his country has been zapped and all its people have turned inward. The poet mourns for a bygone era in which heroes worked for the greater good, but he admits that it is lost. He gives up on it ever coming back.","What need you, being come to sense,
But fumble in a greasy till
And add the halfpence to the pence
And prayer to shivering prayer, until
You have dried the marrow from the bone;
For men were born to pray and save:
Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone,
It’s with O’Leary in the grave.
Yet they were of a different kind,
The names that stilled your childish play,
They have gone about the world like wind,
But little time had they to pray
For whom the hangman’s rope was spun,
And what, God help us, could they save?
Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone,
It’s with O’Leary in the grave.
Was it for this the wild geese spread
The grey wing upon every tide;
For this that all that blood was shed,
For this Edward Fitzgerald died,
And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,
All that delirium of the brave?
Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone,
It’s with O’Leary in the grave.
Yet could we turn the years again,
And call those exiles as they were
In all their loneliness and pain,
You’d cry, ‘Some woman’s yellow hair
Has maddened every mother’s son’:
They weighed so lightly what they gave.
But let them be, they’re dead and gone,
They’re with O’Leary in the grave.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57309/september-1913
Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note by Amiri Baraka,Amiri Baraka,"'Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note' by Amiri Baraka describes a suicidal speaker's mental state and the changes occurring in his life. The speaker of this poem comes across a number of challenges in his day-to-day life. When he goes out to walk his dog, he feels like the ground beneath his feet is enveloping him. Even the wind mocks him when he runs to catch a bus. He usually counts the stars at night, and the gross total interestingly remains the same each day. If there is an absence, he starts counting the holes or gaps. On the final night, he found his daughter talking to herself. He felt so lonely that he probably took his life that night.","Lately, I've become accustomed to the way
The ground opens up and envelopes me
Each time I go out to walk the dog.
Or the broad edged silly music the wind
Makes when I run for a bus . . .

Things have come to that.

And now, each night I count the stars,
And each night I get the same number.
And when they will not come to be counted,
I count the holes they leave.



Nobody sings anymore.

And then last night, I tiptoed up
To my daughter's room and heard her
Talking to someone, and when I opened
The door, there was no one there . . .
Only she on her knees, peeking into

Her own clasped hands.",https://genius.com/Amiri-baraka-preface-to-a-twenty-volume-suicide-note-annotated
The Pulley by George Herbert,George Herbert,"'The Pulley' by George Herbert speaks on one part of the Christian creation story in which God chose to imbue humanity with blessings. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is retelling the story of creation. He is particularly interested in the part where God gives humankind knowledge, wisdom, beauty, and strength. These are important features of human existence that flowed easily from God to humankind. There is one blessing that God did not let out of his cup, rest. He chose to withhold an innate ability to rest from humankind in order to keep his creation close to him. When one gets weary, they turn to God. Or that is his reasoning. Herbert's speaker states that God did not want humanity to love Nature more than they love “the God of Nature.”","When God at first made man,
Having a glass of blessings standing by,
“Let us,” said he, “pour on him all we can.
Let the world’s riches, which dispersèd lie,
Contract into a span.”

So strength first made a way;
Then beauty flowed, then wisdom, honour, pleasure.
When almost all was out, God made a stay,
Perceiving that, alone of all his treasure,
Rest in the bottom lay.

“For if I should,” said he,
“Bestow this jewel also on my creature,
He would adore my gifts instead of me,
And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature;
So both should losers be.

“Yet let him keep the rest,
But keep them with repining restlessness;
Let him be rich and weary, that at least,
If goodness lead him not, yet weariness
May toss him to my breast.”",poetryfoundation.org/poems/44370/the-pulley
2 Mothers in an HDB Playground by Arthur Yap,Arthur Yap,"Form and Tone 2 Mothers in an HDB Playground is in one stanza and presents itself with no rhyming pattern, meaning that the poem is written in free-verse. This is an appropriate as that represents the “rambling nature of parents when they meet in the eponymous playground. The poem's tone is lighthearted and playful, almost comic at times.","ah beng is so smart,

New Day’s Lyric by Amanda Gorman,Amanda Gorman,"'New Day's Lyric' by Amanda Gorman is a hopeful poem that expresses a desire for all people to put aside their differences and come together in the new year. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by saying that the new year is time for everyone to set aside their differences and walk through the door of hope together. She hopes that this will allow the world to change for the better. But, this doesn't mean one should forget the suffering of recent years and the long past. One's “yesterday” can help fuel one's decisions for tomorrow.","May this be the day

We come together.

Mourning, we come to mend,

Withered, we come to weather,

Torn, we come to tend,

Battered, we come to better.

Tethered by this year of yearning,

We are learning

That though we weren't ready for this,

We have been readied by it.

We steadily vow that no matter

How we are weighed down,

We must always pave a way forward.

*

This hope is our door, our portal.

Even if we never get back to normal,

Someday we can venture beyond it,

To leave the known and take the first steps.

So let us not return to what was normal,

But reach toward what is next.

*

What was cursed, we will cure.

What was plagued, we will prove pure.

Where we tend to argue, we will try to agree,

Those fortunes we forswore, now the future we foresee,

Where we weren't aware, we're now awake;

Those moments we missed

Are now these moments we make,

The moments we meet,

And our hearts, once altogether beaten,

Now all together beat.

*

Come, look up with kindness yet,

For even solace can be sourced from sorrow.

We remember, not just for the sake of yesterday,

But to take on tomorrow.

*

We heed this old spirit,

In a new day's lyric,

In our hearts, we hear it:

For auld lang syne, my dear,

For auld lang syne.

Be bold, sang Time this year,

Be bold, sang Time,

For when you honor yesterday,

Tomorrow ye will find.

Know what we've fought

Need not be forgot nor for none.

It defines us, binds us as one,

Home is so Sad by Philip Larkin,Philip Larkin,"Home is so Sad' by Philip Larkin is a touching ten-line poem that describes what happens to a home when people begin to leave it behind. The poem uses personification to describe the home as a suffering creature, something that has lost what it loved and would do anything to bring it back. There is a comforting space it fosters for whoever left it behind. It's always ready to allow that person back in. In the second stanza, the speaker notes some of the variety of images that mark change and loss in a home.","Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,
Shaped to the comfort of the last to go
As if to win them back. Instead, bereft
Of anyone to please, it withers so,
Having no heart to put aside the theft

And turn again to what it started as,
A joyous shot at how things ought to be,
Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:
Look at the pictures and the cutlery.
The music in the piano stool. That vase.",https://poets.org/poem/home-so-sad
Sonnet 10 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any' by William Shakespeare is one of several poems addressed to the Fair Youth that deals with procreation. The poem is one of the harsher, more direct in the series. In it, the speaker once again accuses the youth of being a murderer for not wanting to have a child. He tells the young man that everyone loves him and that he should have a child, if not for their sake or his, then for the speaker. It would allow his beauty to persevere in another after he dies. Read more poetry from William Shakespeare here.","For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Who for thy self art so unprovident.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,
That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
Make thee another self for love of me,
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.",https://shakespeares-sonnets.com/sonnet/10
‘La Belle Dame Sans Merci’ by John Keats,John Keats,"‘La Belle Dame sans Merci’ by John Keats is a beautiful poem about a fairy who condemns a knight after seducing him with her singing and looks. The first three stanzas introduce the unidentified speaker and the knight. The speaker comes across the knight wandering around in the dead of winter when “the sedge has withered from the lake/ And no birds sing.” In this way, Keats depicts a barren and bleak landscape. The knight responds to the speaker, telling him how he met a lady in the meadows who was “full beautiful, a faery’s child”. Here, Keats’ language sweetens. The first three stanzas were bitter and devoid of emotion, but the introduction of the “lady in the meads” produces softness in the language of the knight. He reminisces on the lady’s beauty and her apparent innocence – her long hair, light feet, and wild eyes – and on her otherworldliness, as well. Moreover, he describes his sweet memories of the Lady: feeding each other, giving her presents, traveling with her, and being together.","Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,
Alone and palely loitering;
The sedge is withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.

Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
And the harvest's done.

I see a lilly on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever dew;
And on thy cheek a fading rose
Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful, a faery's child;
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long;
For sideways would she lean, and sing
A faery's song.

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna dew;
And sure in language strange she said,
I love thee true.

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she gazed and sighed deep,
And there I shut her wild sad eyes—
So kissed to sleep.

And there we slumbered on the moss,
And there I dreamed, ah woe betide,
The latest dream I ever dreamed
On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings, and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
Who cried—""La belle Dame sans merci
Hath thee in thrall!""

I saw their starved lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke, and found me here
On the cold hill side.

And this is why I sojourn here
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
And no birds sing.","https://poemanalysis.com/poetry-explained/compare-la-belle-dame-sans-merci-and-sonnet-116/#:~:text=Shakespeare's%20'Sonnet%20116'%20is%20spoken,the%20knight%20and%20the%20lady."
Elegy for Jane by Theodore Roethke,Theodore Roethke,"'Elegy for Jane' by Theodore Roethke uses intense natural images to depict a deceased young woman and the love the speaker has for her. Throughout this poem, Roethke's speaker uses interesting and memorable images of nature to describe the life of one of his students, Jane. She died after being thrown from her horse and her loss has impacted him deeply. He did not love her as a father or as a lover but he feels in her death the loss of something integral. Since her bird-like presence has left the earth, he has found himself unable to take pleasure in the natural world. The poem ends without a resolution, he is still mourning her and has come to no conclusion about what his next steps should be.","(My student, thrown by a horse)

I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils;
And her quick look, a sidelong pickerel smile;
And how, once started into talk, the light syllables leaped for her.
And she balanced in the delight of her thought,
A wren, happy, tail into the wind,
Her song trembling the twigs and small branches.
The shade sang with her;
The leaves, their whispers turned to kissing,
And the mould sang in the bleached valleys under the rose.

Oh, when she was sad, she cast herself down into such a pure depth,
Even a father could not find her:
Scraping her cheek against straw,
Stirring the clearest water.
My sparrow, you are not here,
Waiting like a fern, making a spiney shadow.
The sides of wet stones cannot console me,
Nor the moss, wound with the last light.

If only I could nudge you from this sleep,
My maimed darling, my skittery pigeon.
Over this damp grave I speak the words of my love:
I, with no rights in this matter,
Neither father nor lover.",poemhunter.com/poem/elegy-for-jane/
The Depths by Denise Levertov,Denise Levertov,"The Depths by Denise Levertov is a three-stanza work that uses contradictions and metaphor to express how multi-layered life can be. The overview of life includes good things and bad things, proving that life is filled with varying elements that exist in both positive and negative states of being. At some points, in fact, it is hard to discern what the good and bad are within the poem’s situations, which helps to solidify this contrasting method of expressing differentiation. To Levertov, it seems, life is neither primarily filled with good or bad, but its “depths” are still worth “tast[ing].” This thought is the theme of the poem.","When the white fog burns off,
the abyss of everlasting light
is revealed. The last cobwebs
of fog in the
black fir trees are flakes
of white ash in the world's hearth.

Cold of the sea is counterpart
to this great fire. Plunging
out of the burning cold of ocean
we enter an ocean of intense
noon. Sacred salt
sparkles on our bodies.

After mist has wrapped us again
in fine wool, may the taste of salt
recall to us the great depths about us",https://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/Poets/L/LevertovDeni/Depths/index.html
Animal Fair,A List of Popular Nursery Rhymes,"'Animal Fair' is a funny rhyme that's often sung in a round. It describes the actions of a couple of human-like animals. The narrator describes going to an animal fair and seeing two animals there. These are only two among the many birds and beasts on display. There is a monkey in most versions; sometimes, a skunk or raccoon replaces it. He gets drunk, sits on the elephant's trunk, and then is blown off when the latter sneezes. There are few details about this poem, but alternative versions do provide more child-friendly lines, removing the word “drunk” and its implications.","We went to the animal fair,
The birds and the beasts were there,
The big baboon by the light of the moon
Was combing his golden hair.
The monkey fell out of his bunk,
And slid down the elephant's trunk,
The elephant sneezed - Achoo!
And fell on her knees,
And what became of the monkey,
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/school-radio/nursery-rhymes-the-animal-fair/z766wty
Battle-Hymn of the Republic by Julia Ward Howe,Julia Ward Howe,"Battle-Hymn of the Republic', Julia Ward Howe talks about Christ's reappearance on earth to do justice with those who were suffering and being oppressed. In this poem, the poet alludes to several biblical passages. The speaker depicts Christ as a savior who will bring peace again in this world. She can see him appearing in his glorious outlook to redeem mankind as he did before. But, this time he won't be too kind to those who previously wiped humanity from the face of the earth. According to the speaker, he is a warrior now, beaming with heroism and vibrant with vengeful energy. However, the portrayal of Christ as a hero and as a warrior hints at something else. Here, the poet tries to infuse the audience with the heroic energy of Christ. In this way, they can get justice for themselves. Jesus Christ is just a metaphor in their proclamation of resistance.","Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fatal lightning of his terrible swift sword:
His truth is marching on.
I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.
His Day is marching on.
I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel:
“As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,
Since God is marching on.”
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment-seat:
Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me:
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
While God is marching on.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44420/battle-hymn-of-the-republic
The Death of Cuchulain by William Butler Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"The Death of Cuchulain 'The Death of Cuchulain' by William Butler Yeats is a dramatic retelling of the death of the heroic character from Irish mythology, Cuchulain. The poem takes the reader through a series of events that bring in Cuchulain's wife, Emer, and son Finmole. Emer sends her son to fight her husband after getting the news that “With him is one sweet-throated like a bird”. There is another woman in his life, someone who is only described as “young” and “sweet”. Finmole goes to fight his father, does not reveal his identity, and is killed. Cuchulain mourns his death for three days. While in the forest, the king tells his druids to cast a spell on the old hero and send him to his death in the waves. They do so and Cuchulain fights with the sea for four more days before succumbing.","A man came slowly from the setting sun,
To Forgail's daughter, Emer, in her dun,
And found her dyeing cloth with subtle care,
And said, casting aside his draggled hair:
"" I am Aleel, the swineherd, whom you bid
Go dwell upon the sea cliffs, vapour hid;
But now my years of watching are no more.""

Then Emer cast her web upon the floor,
And stretching her arms, red with the dye,
Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.

Looking on her, Aleel, the swineherd, said:
"" Not any god alive, nor mortal dead,
Has slain so mighty armies, so great kings,
Nor won the gold that now Cuchulain brings.""

"" Why do you tremble thus from feet to crown?""

Aleel, the swineherd, wept and cast him down
Upon the web-heaped floor, and thus his word:
"" With him is one sweet-throated like a bird.""

"" Who bade you tell these things?"" and then she cried
To those about, "" Beat him with thongs of hide
And drive him from the door.""
And thus it was:
And where her son, Finmole, on the smooth grass
Was driving cattle, came she with swift feet,
And called out to him, "" Son, it is not meet
That you stay idling here with flocks and herds.""
"" I long have waited, mother, for those words:
But wherefore now?""
"" There is a man to die;
You have the heaviest arm under the sky.""

"" My father dwells among the sea-worn bands
And breaks the ridge of battle with his hands.""

"" Nay, you are taller than Cuchulain, son.""

"" He is the mightiest man in ship or dun.""

"" Nay, he is old and sad with many wars,
And weary of the crash of battle cars.""

"" I only ask what way my journey lies,
For God, who made you bitter, made you wise.""

"" The Red Branch kings a tireless banquet keep,
Where the sun falls into the Western deep.
Go there, and dwell on the green forest rim;
But tell alone your name and house to him
Whose blade compels, and bid them send you one
Who has a like vow from their triple dun.""

Between the lavish shelter of a wood
And the gray tide, the Red Branch multitude
Feasted, and with them old Cuchulain dwelt,
And his young dear one close beside him knelt,
And gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes,
More mournful than the depth of starry skies,
And pondered on the wonder of his days;
And all around the harp-string told his praise,
And Concobar, the Red Branch king of kings,
With his own fingers touched the brazen strings.
At last Cuchulain spake: "" A young man strays
Driving the deer along the woody ways.
I often hear him singing to and fro,
I often hear the sweet sound of his bow.
Seek out what man he is.""
One went and came.
"" He bade me let all know he gives his name
At the sword point, and bade me bring him one
Who had a like vow from our triple dun.""

"" I only of the Red Branch hosted now,""
Cuchulain cried, "" have made and keep that vow.""
After short fighting in the leafy shade,
He spake to the young man, "" Is there no maid
Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,
Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,
That you come here to meet this ancient sword?""

"" The dooms of men are in God's hidden hoard.""

"" Your head a while seemed like a woman's head
That I loved once.""
Again the fighting sped,
But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke,
And through the other's shield his long blade broke,
And pierced him.
"" Speak before your breath is done.""

"" I am Finmole, mighty Cuchulain's son.""

"" I put you from your pain. I can no more.""

While day its burden on to evening bore,
With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;
Then Concobar sent that sweet-throated maid,
And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed;
In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.
Then Concobar, the subtlest of all men,
Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,
Spake thus: "" Cuchulain will dwell there and brood,
For three days more in dreadful quietude,
And then arise, and raving slay us all.
Go, cast on him delusions magical,
That he may fight the waves of the loud sea.""
And ten by ten under a quicken tree,
The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands
Tall wands of alder, and white quicken wands.

In three days' time, Cuchulain with a moan
Stood up, and came to the long sands alone:
For four days warred he with the bitter tide;
And the waves flowed above him, and he died.",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/death-cuchulain
On Eastnor Knoll by John Masefield,John Masefield,"‘On Eastnor Knoll’ by John Masefield elegantly and poetically depicts the end of the day and the setting of the sun below the horizon.
The poem takes the reader through a series of powerful images of the sunset, moonrise, and the casting of the world into shadow. Masefield uses a variety of poetic techniques to help the reader imagine what it was like to see that particular sunset and all other sunsets since time began.","Silent are the woods, and the dim green boughs are
Hushed in the twilight: yonder, in the path through
The apple orchard, is a tired plough-boy
Calling the cows home.

A bright white star blinks, the pale moon rounds, but
Still the red, lurid wreckage of the sunset
Smoulders in smoky fire, and burns on
The misty hill-tops.

Ghostly it grows, and darker, the burning
Fades into smoke, and now the gusty oaks are
A silent army of phantoms thronging
A land of shadows.",https://allpoetry.com/On-Eastnor-Knoll
Sonnet 104 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"Sonnet 104, 'To me, fair friend, you never can be old,' by William Shakespeare addresses the facts of aging and the possibility that the Fair Youth is effected just as much as anyone else is. The poem is addressed to the Fair Youth, who is throughout the text complimented on his beauty. He seems not to have aged the whole time the speaker has known him. Over the last three years, he has remained just as fresh and green as when they first met. But, the speaker acknowledges towards the end, he knows this can't be the case. All people age and time moves so slowly that he just can't see it. The final two lines are addressed to future generations. He tells them that when they are alive, the most beautiful person to have ever lived will have already died.","To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:
Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/50387/sonnet-104-to-me-fair-friend-you-never-can-be-old
The City of Sleep by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling,"The City of Sleep' by Rudyard Kipling features in the author's popular short story “The Brushwood Boy” and depicts the shared dreams at the centre of the story. The poem takes the reader through an emotional depiction of the world of dreams and the waking world. In the stanzas, the young woman who is singing them, describes the nature of Merciful Town and everyone's desire to lay down their tools and troubles and go there. It is a place where one can escape from their life, but, it is not always accessible.","Over the edge of the purple down,
Where the single lamplight gleams,
Know ye the road to the Merciful Town
That is hard by the Sea of Dreams –
Where the poor may lay their wrongs away,
And the sick may forget to weep?
But we – pity us! Oh, pity us!
We wakeful; ah, pity us! –
We must go back with Policeman Day –
Back from the City of Sleep!
Weary they turn from the scroll and crown,
Fetter and prayer and plough –
They that go up to the Merciful Town,
For her gates are closing now.
It is their right in the Baths of Night
Body and soul to steep,
But we – pity us! ah, pity us!
We wakeful; oh, pity us! –
We must go back with Policeman Day –
Back from the City of Sleep!
Over the edge of the purple down,
Ere the tender dreams begin,
Look – we may look – at the Merciful Town,
But we may not enter in!
Outcasts all, from her guarded wall
Back to our watch we creep:
We – pity us! ah, pity us!
We wakeful; ah, pity us! –
We that go back with Policeman Day –
Back from the City of Sleep!",poetryfoundation.org/poems/53763/the-city-of-sleep
Mother’s Song by Shirley Lim,Shirley Geok-Lin Lim,"'Mother's Song' by Shirley Lim is a touching poem that speaks on themes of love and motherhood and it depicts aging milestones in a man's life. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that imagine a baby in various stages of his future life. He grows, becoming a young, energetic boy. Soon though he's getting older and growing more distant from his mother. Eventually, he's playing at “groom” and getting crows feet and silver hair.","Beautiful man, milk teeth bared in a trap,
Whose mouth curls in despair,
She smiles at your face.
Beautiful man, twitching boy’s shoulders
Like many golden carp
Swimming to her gaze.
Beautiful man, your white skin turns redder,
Your slit eyes grow wide,
Your chin’s fuzzed with moth.
Beautiful man, fingers knifing, stab
Or roll, winding up thoughts
Like fine hair, like cloth.
Beautiful man, leaning back stock-still, now
Bunched in fury, fishy,
You play at the groom.
Beautiful man, crowsfeet walk your brow.
Your head pulls as the tide
Silvering the room.
Beautiful man, bitter, slipping her grasp.
Like strong medicine, harsh tea,
She swallows her doubts.",http://www.poetry.sg/shirley-geok-lin-lim-mothers-song
The Prediction by Mark Strand,Mark Strand,"'The Prediction' by Mark Strand shows a young woman visualizing her future through a poem being written by a man in her room. This piece begins with an image of a moonlit night, and the moon drifted over a pond, making the water white. On such a wonderful night, a young woman walked alone. Suddenly, the future flashed before her eyes. She could see a similar scene reflected in a poem written by a man sitting in her room. In the image, the moon hides behind the clouds, leaving his paper utterly dark.","That night the moon drifted over the pond, turning the water to milk, and under the boughs of the trees, the blue trees, a young woman walked, and for an instant
the future came to her:
rain falling on her husband’s grave, rain falling on the lawns of her children, her own mouth
filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house,
a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it, a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death,
thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising
and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49158/the-prediction
After Death by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"'After Death' is from the perspective of somebody who appears to be dead. It sets the scene of a domestic environment, where perhaps the narrator is on her deathbed. Then a foreign figure enters who 'leaned above' the narrator. What follows is a progression of mourning in which the male figure expresses sympathy, 'poor child', then cries. The speaker expresses discontent in how this figure did not touch her or do other comforting acts to ease her state. 'After Death' ends with a selfless statement; where the narrator says that despite the male's lack of love, she is still glad that he lives. This poem acknowledges the continuation of ordinary life after a person's death, and it distances itself from the religious connotations associated with the 'afterlife'.","The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may
Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,
Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.
He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
And could not hear him; but I heard him say,
‘Poor child, poor child’: and as he turned away
Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.
He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
He did not love me living; but once dead
He pitied me; and very sweet it is
To know he still is warm though I am cold.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50497/after-death
The Coronet by Andrew Marvell,Andrew Marvell,"The Coronet' by Andrew Marvell refers back to the Crucifixion story and he wants to make amends for the wrongs done to Jesus Christ. 'The Coronet' by Andrew Marvell presents the poet's attempt to honor Christ with his poetic “coronet”. To weave these garlands of honor, the poet would even remove the flowers which his beloved women have been wearing in their tall head-dresses. What the poet means is that he would collect the best available words and phrases to write a suitable poem in praise of Christ. However, the poet is now overcome by doubt. He finds the old serpent lurking amongst the flowers of the garlands which he has woven. In other words, he finds that the poem that is trying to write has been prompted by a desire to seek fame and in the hope of worldly advancement. Fame and self-interest are the temptations offered to him by Satan. The poet now scolds himself for allowing selfish motives to mar his tribute to Christ. Finally, he appeals to Christ directly to trample upon both the serpent and the garlands which the poet has so skillfully woven. His garlands could not crown Christ's head; but, when Christ tramples upon them, they will crown his feet. ","When for the thorns with which I long, too long,
With many a piercing wound,
My Saviour’s head have crowned,
I seek with garlands to redress that wrong:
Through every garden, every mead,
I gather flowers (my fruits are only flowers),
Dismantling all the fragrant towers
That once adorned my shepherdess’s head.
And now when I have summed up all my store,
Thinking (so I myself deceive)
So rich a chaplet thence to weave
As never yet the King of Glory wore:
Alas, I find the serpent old
That, twining in his speckled breast,
About the flowers disguised does fold,
With wreaths of fame and interest.
Ah, foolish man, that wouldst debase with them,
And mortal glory, Heaven’s diadem!
But Thou who only couldst the serpent tame,
Either his slippery knots at once untie;
And disentangle all his winding snare;
Or shatter too with him my curious frame,
And let these wither, so that he may die,
Though set with skill and chosen out with care:
That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread,
May crown thy feet, that could not crown thy head.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48328/the-coronet
The Ghazal “In Real Time” By Agha Shahid Ali,Agha Shahid Ali,"A ghazal is a poetic form that consists of rhyming couplets and a refrain with each line sharing the same meter. The refrain for this In Real Time ghazal poem is the phrase “In real time,” and it is repeated at the end of its every couplet. Ali takes that structure and applies it to a poem that reveals, through short eleven-syllable lines, the hellish nature of life in India, Ali’s home country. Pain, suffering, and injustice have all been intertwined very skillfully and carefully to create powerful meaning within the complex structure of a ghazal, which relates directly to the complicated social structure that is central to the underlying meaning of the poem. First developed in the 6th century in pre-Islamic-Arabic verse, this style of poetry has very personal ties with Ali as it pays homage to his Hindu and Muslim heritage. Concurrently many of his themes that Ali uses correlate with that heritage, as well. “Exile, nostalgia for lost or ruined landscapes, and political conflict” inform Ali’s all poetic works and expose his heritage. In this ghazal poem, all of these themes are evident.","I’ll do what I must if I’m bold in real time. A refugee, I’ll be paroled in real time.
Cool evidence clawed off like shirts of hell-fire? A former existence untold in real time ...
The one you would choose: Were you led then by him? What longing, O Yaar, is controlled in real time?
Each syllable sucked under waves of our earth—
The funeral love comes to hold in real time!
They left him alive so that he could be lonely—
The god of small things is not consoled in real time.
Please afterwards empty my pockets of keys—
It’s hell in the city of gold in real time.
God’s angels again are—for Satan!—forlorn. Salvation was bought but sin sold in real time.
And who is the terrorist, who the victim?
We’ll know if the country is polled in real time.
“Behind a door marked DANGER” are being unwound
the prayers my friend had enscrolled in real time.
The throat of the rearview and sliding down it the Street of Farewell’s now unrolled in real time.
I heard the incessant dissolving of silk—
I felt my heart growing so old in real time.
Her heart must be ash where her body lies burned. What hope lets your hands rake the cold in real time?
Now Friend, the Belovèd has stolen your words—
Read slowly: The plot will unfold in real time.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43279/ghazal-56d221fe8a756
The Thought-Fox by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"Paradoxically, a lot of Ted Hughes' poetry reaches back to muse and author models, favoring an old-fashioned format that was ridiculed by other poets. While Movement poetry was a closed system, a down-to-earth, humanistic approach to poetry, Hughes wrote with mystical language and the idea of something more. As Hughes himself said, “One of the things those poets had in common I think was the post-war mood of having ha enough … enough rhetoric, enough overweening push of any kind, enough of the dark gods, enough of the id, enough of the Angelic powers and the heroic efforts to make new worlds. They'd seen it all turn into death-camps and atomic bombs. All they wanted was to get back in civvies and get home to the wife and kids and for the rest of their lives, not a thing was going to interfere with a nice cigarette and a nice view of the park …. Now I came a bit later. I hadn't had enough. I was all for opening negotiations with whatever happened to be out there.” 'The Thought-Fox', which you can read in full here, takes this approach to poetry. It is a poem about the writing of a poem, utilizing the symbol of the fox to stand for the idea of the muse: fleeting and quick, it haunts the poet-writer, disturbing his quiet night.","I imagine this midnight moment’s forest:
Something else is alive
Beside the clock’s loneliness
And this blank page where my fingers move.
Through the window I see no star:
Something more near
Though deeper within darkness
Is entering the loneliness:
Cold, delicately as the dark snow
A fox’s nose touches twig, leaf;
Two eyes serve a movement, that now
And again now, and now, and now
Sets neat prints into the snow
Between trees, and warily a lame
Shadow lags by stump and in hollow
Of a body that is bold to come
Across clearings, an eye,
A widening deepening greenness,
Brilliantly, concentratedly,
Coming about its own business
Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox
It enters the dark hole of the head.
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,
The page is printed.",https://poetryarchive.org/poem/thought-fox/
Coat by Jane Duran,Jane Duran,"'Coat' by Jane Duran describes a windy winter night of New York City. The speaker recollects her childhood memory of walking with her mother in the city. This poem shares a beautiful memory of the poet's childhood. She shares one of her memories concerning her mother. While sharing the story, she also looks back to another memory with her grandmother. Whatsoever the main idea of the poem revolves around her mother's coat which gave warmth to her in the chilling night of New York City. Often, when they went for a walk on winter nights, her mother embraced her and covered her with her coat. This scene reminds her of her mother, probably not with her when she was writing this poem.","When it was bitter in New York City,
I would go out with my mother
past the icy buildings, stay
against her, just behind her
so she would stop the wind and snow,
and bury my face in her coat,
just there under her arm.
All winter, like her walk-in closet,
Its yellow light, I would walk into her,
Shake out my raw thoughts.
I didn't know who or what we were passing
or even if the city was still there,
the long radiant hairs against my face
like my grandmother's stole
with fox's head that lay on her breast,
me, clinging to my mortal mother,
our slow progress down that black, warm street.",http://margaret-cooter.blogspot.com/2017/12/poetry-thursday-coat-by-jane-duran.html
There Was a Crooked Man by Mother Goose,Mother Goose,"There Was a Crooked Man' by Mother Goose is a short, upbeat poem that uses repetition to speak on a series of “crooked” sights. The four-line poem begins by describing a “crooked man” who “walked a crooked mile”. While walking, he came upon a “sixpence” that was, as one might expect, also crooked. The next lines depict a “crooked cat” and mouse as well as a “little crooked house” in which they all end up.","There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile,
He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile;
He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse,
And they all lived together in a little crooked house.","https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46948/there-was-a-crooked-man-56d22710e66f5#:~:text=There%20was%20a%20crooked%20man%2C%20and%20he%20walked%20a%20crooked,in%20a%20little%20crooked%20house."
"It is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free by William Wordsworth",William Wordsworth,"William Wordsworth was fascinated by the innocence of children, and their natural connection to nature; he viewed it as an expression of their deeper innocence that they were not affected by the beauty of the natural surroundings the same way that he was, were not moved to tears the same way that he was. Thus, he came to the conclusion that nature – to Wordsworth akin to the divine – was lost when men grew older. It is notable that this is the first sonnet that Wordsworth ever wrote. Discover more William Wordsworth poems.","It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
The holy time is quiet as a Nun
Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
Is sinking down in its tranquility;
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea;
Listen! the mighty Being is awake,
And doth with his eternal motion make
A sound like thunder—everlastingly.
Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,
If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,
Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;
And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,
God being with thee when we know it not.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45524/it-is-a-beauteous-evening-calm-and-free
A Long Journey by Musaemura Zimunya,Musaemura Zimunya,"'A Long Journey' by Musaemura Zimunya explores how an African village transformed because of British colonialism. In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by describing the long journey that his town has been on. Their long history of tradition was interrupted by British colonialism. The speaker represents this through the image of the motor car, bicycle, and boss. The city was “brought into the village,” and people began looking to the future and to other places. The speaker bounces between feelings of acceptance about the New World in which their living and feelings of regret regarding what's been lost in the past. They do not ignore the benefits that have come to their village but are well aware of the dark hand of the past, reminding everyone of what's been lost.","Through decades that ran like rivers
endless rivers of endless woes
through pick and shovel sjambok and jail
O such a long long journey

When the motor-car came
the sledge and the ox-cart began to die
but for a while the bicycle made in Britain
was the dream of every village boy

With the arrival of the bus
the city was brought into the village
and we began to yearn for the place behind the horizons

Such a long travail it was
a long journey from bush to concrete

And now I am haunted by the cave dwelling
hidden behind eighteen ninety
threatening my new-found luxury
in this the capital city of my mother country
I fight in nightmarish vain
but my road runs and turns into dusty gravel
into over-beaten foot tracks that lead
to a plastic hut and soon to a mud-grass dwelling
threatened by wind and rain and cold

We have fled from witches and wizards
on a long long road to the city
but behind the halo of tower lights
I hear the cry from human blood
and wicked bones rattling around me

We moved into the lights
but from the dark periphery behind
an almighty hand reaches for our shirts.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-long-journey-5/
Not my Best Side by U. A. Fanthorpe,U.A. Fanthorpe,"Not my Best Side' U. A. Fanthorpe is a humorous transformation of the dynamic between the characters in Paolo Uccello's Saint George and the Dragon. The poem starts from the perspective of the dragon. He knows he has to be slain, as that's in the story, but he expresses his disappointment that this particular knight, with his strange horse, is going to be the one to do it. He's also annoyed that he wasn't painted better or more bloodied, as if dying dramatically. He goes on to speak ill of the woman he's supposedly wanting to eat, calling her too ugly to be edible. Next, the poet moves on to give the reader the woman's perspective. Rather than feeling fear, she too is disappointed by the knight who's come to save her. She's actually enjoyed spending time with the dragon. She sexualizes him, speaking kindly and lustfully about his colorful scales. Finally, the readers get to hear from the knight. Again, the poet puts forward a perceptive that is different than what is expected. Rather than valiant and brave, the knight comes across as self-absorbed and whiny. He becomes easily frustrated with the dragon's lack of cooperation.","Not my best side, I'm afraid.
The artist didn't give me a chance to
Pose properly, and as you can see,
Poor chap, he had this obsession with
Triangles, so he left off two of my
Feet. I didn't comment at the time
(What, after all, are two feet
To a monster?) but afterwards
I was sorry for the bad publicity.
Why, I said to myself, should my conqueror
Be so ostentatiously beardless, and ride
A horse with a deformed neck and square hoofs?
Why should my victim be so
Unattractive as to be inedible,
And why should she have me literally
On a string? I don't mind dying
Ritually, since I always rise again,
But I should have liked a little more blood
To show they were taking me seriously.

It's hard for a girl to be sure if
She wants to be rescued. I mean, I quite
Took to the dragon. It's nice to be
Liked, if you know what I mean. He was
So nicely physical, with his claws
And lovely green skin, and that sexy tail,
And the way he looked at me,
He made me feel he was all ready to
Eat me. And any girl enjoys that.
So when this boy turned up, wearing machinery,
On a really dangerous horse, to be honest
I didn't much fancy him. I mean,
What was he like underneath the hardware?
He might have acne, blackheads or even
Bad breath for all I could tell, but the dragon--
Well, you could see all his equipment
At a glance. Still, what could I do?
The dragon got himself beaten by the boy,
And a girl's got to think of her future.


I have diplomas in Dragon
Management and Virgin Reclamation.
My horse is the latest model, with
Automatic transmission and built-in
Obsolescence. My spear is custom-built,
And my prototype armour
Still on the secret list. You can't
Do better than me at the moment.
I'm qualified and equipped to the
Eyebrow. So why be difficult?
Don't you want to be killed and/or rescued
In the most contemporary way? Don't
You want to carry out the roles
That sociology and myth have designed for you?
Don't you realize that, by being choosy,
You are endangering job prospects
In the spear- and horse-building industries?
What, in any case, does it matter what
You want? You're in my way.",https://genius.com/U-a-fanthorpe-not-my-best-side-annotated
Night Mail by W.H. Auden,W.H. Auden,"Night Mail' by W.H. Auden is a powerful depiction and analyzes the impact of a night train carrying the mail through the Scottish countryside. The poem conforms to a consistent rhyme scheme and metrical pattern that follows the path of a train. It carries letters from every part of the world on every topic up a hill and through the grasses. The smoke flies over the train and into the distance as it powers forward towards the city. Once there, in amongst all the sleeping people, it delivers the much longed-for notes from friends, associates, business partners, and family members. Each recipient is gladdened by the feeling of remembrance, of not being forgotten. ","This is the night mail crossing the Border,
Bringing the cheque and the postal order,

Letters for the rich, letters for the poor,
The shop at the corner, the girl next door.

Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb:
The gradient's against her, but she's on time.

Past cotton-grass and moorland boulder
Shovelling white steam over her shoulder,

Snorting noisily as she passes
Silent miles of wind-bent grasses.

Birds turn their heads as she approaches,
Stare from bushes at her blank-faced coaches.

Sheep-dogs cannot turn her course;
They slumber on with paws across.

In the farm she passes no one wakes,
But a jug in a bedroom gently shakes.


Dawn freshens, Her climb is done.
Down towards Glasgow she descends,
Towards the steam tugs yelping down a glade of cranes
Towards the fields of apparatus, the furnaces
Set on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen.
All Scotland waits for her:
In dark glens, beside pale-green lochs
Men long for news.


Letters of thanks, letters from banks,
Letters of joy from girl and boy,
Receipted bills and invitations
To inspect new stock or to visit relations,
And applications for situations,
And timid lovers' declarations,
And gossip, gossip from all the nations,
News circumstantial, news financial,
Letters with holiday snaps to enlarge in,
Letters with faces scrawled on the margin,
Letters from uncles, cousins, and aunts,
Letters to Scotland from the South of France,
Letters of condolence to Highlands and Lowlands
Written on paper of every hue,
The pink, the violet, the white and the blue,
The chatty, the catty, the boring, the adoring,
The cold and official and the heart's outpouring,
Clever, stupid, short and long,
The typed and the printed and the spelt all wrong.

Thousands are still asleep,
Dreaming of terrifying monsters
Or of friendly tea beside the band in Cranston's or Crawford's:

Asleep in working Glasgow, asleep in well-set Edinburgh,
Asleep in granite Aberdeen,
They continue their dreams,
But shall wake soon and hope for letters,
And none will hear the postman's knock
Without a quickening of the heart,
For who can bear to feel himself forgotten?",https://allpoetry.com/Night-Mail
The Hollow Men by T.S. Eliot,T.S. Eliot,"The Hollow Men' by T.S. Eliot describes a group of “Hollow Men” who live in a barren world as they await a change in their circumstances. The poem begins with the speaker, who is really a group, describing how their lives as “The Hollow Men.” They are, or they are like a group of scarecrows. The men are exiting somewhere between life and death, in a world, they have no agency in. It becomes clear as the poem progresses that they are unable to enter into true death. There is no money for them to cross the river. Instead, they have to wait for something to change. At the end of the poem, the men are described as dancing around a cactus and singing. Even in this context, they are unable to finish the song or their prayers to God. The poem ends with the speaker stating that the world is going to end anticlimactically. There will be no big explosion, instead, it will go out with a whisper.","Mistah Kurtz-he dead
A penny for the Old Guy
We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar
Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;
Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom
Remember us-if at all-not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men.
Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dream kingdom
These do not appear:
There, the eyes are
Sunlight on a broken column
There, is a tree swinging
And voices are
In the wind's singing
More distant and more solemn
Than a fading star.
Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom
Let me also wear
Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer-
Not that final meeting
In the twilight kingdom
This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here the stone images
Are raised, here they receive
The supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star.
Is it like this
In death's other kingdom
Waking alone
At the hour when we are
Trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss
Form prayers to broken stone.
The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river
Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men.
Here we go round the prickly pear
Prickly pear prickly pear
Here we go round the prickly pear
At five o'clock in the morning.
Between the idea
And the reality
Between the motion
And the act
Falls the Shadow
For Thine is the Kingdom
Between the conception
And the creation
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the Shadow
Life is very long
Between the desire
And the spasm
Between the potency
And the existence
Between the essence
And the descent
Falls the Shadow

For Thine is
Life is

Nani by Alberto Ríos,Alberto Ríos,"'Nani' by Alberto Ríos is a thoughtful poem in which the speaker addresses his heritage and his connection to his Nani. The poem starts with the speaker describing being served a specific dish. As the lines progress, it becomes clear that he cares deeply for his Nani, as she does for him. But, there is some barrier to their ability to communicate clearly with one another. The speaker is often lost for words, and she's using those that he no longer understands. He spends the second stanza describing his Nani and the life she led. There is evidence of it in all of her wrinkles. They tell stories about her connections to other people and other family members. The poem concludes with her serving the speaker more food before he can find the words to tell her whether he wants more or not.","Sitting at her table, she serves
the sopa de arroz to me
instinctively, and I watch her,
the absolute mamá, and eat words
I might have had to say more
out of embarrassment. To speak,
now-foreign words I used to speak,
too, dribble down her mouth as she serves
me albóndigas. No more
than a third are easy to me.
By the stove she does something with words
and looks at me only with her
back. I am full. I tell her
I taste the mint, and watch her speak
smiles at the stove. All my words
make her smile. Nani never serves
herself, she only watches me
with her skin, her hair. I ask for more.

I watch the mamá warming more
tortillas for me. I watch her
fingers in the flame for me.
Near her mouth, I see a wrinkle speak
of a man whose body serves
the ants like she serves me, then more words
from more wrinkles about children, words
about this and that, flowing more
easily from these other mouths. Each serves
as a tremendous string around her,
holding her together. They speak
Nani was this and that to me
and I wonder just how much of me
will die with her, what were the words
I could have been, was. Her insides speak
through a hundred wrinkles, now, more
than she can bear, steel around her,
shouting, then, What is this thing she serves?

She asks me if I want more.
I own no words to stop her.
Even before I speak, she serves.",https://poets.org/poem/nani
The Constant Lover by Sir John Suckling,John Suckling,"'The Constant Lover' by Sir John Suckling describes a three-day-old love affair and the way the speaker is considering its future. In the first stanza, the speaker notes that he's been in love for three days. This is something he's not shy about. Nor does he seem self-conscious about the fact that people do not fall in love in such a short period of time. He addresses it clearly and even notes that he knows it could not last. But, his love is so constant (more so than anyone else in the world) that he thinks it will. At the end of the poem, readers are confronted with new opinions from the speaker that may change their minds about him.","Out upon it, I have lov'd
Three whole days together;
And am like to love three more,
If it prove fair weather.

Time shall molt away his wings
Ere he shall discover
In such whole wide world again
Such a constant lover.

But the spite on't is, no praise
Is due at all to me:
Love with me had made no stays
Had it any been but she.

Had it any been but she
And that very face,
There had been at least ere this
A dozen dozen in her place.",https://allpoetry.com/The-Constant-Lover
Keyways by Owen Sheers,Owen Sheers,"In ‘Keyways’, Sheers portrays himself and his ex-girlfriend after breaking up, waiting for a set of keys to be cut so that he can go and retrieve his belongings from her flat. The poem takes places after the relationship has ended, and has a somber tone throughout. While waiting in line, Sheers thinks back over his relationship, using the extended metaphor of a key being cut to represent the impact of moments of his relationship upon him. The final failure to connect, the key which doesn’t turn in the lock, is a symbol of the relationship breaking down. The poem is typical to Sheers, intertwining themes of relationships, and memory seamlessly.","Strange then, that this should be our last time together.
Standing in line at the locksmith's
waiting for a set of your keys to be cut
so I can visit your flat when you're out
and take back all that's mine again.

The hot day outside presses to the shop window glass,
lights the uncut sets along the wall
like lucky charms along a bracelet.
And I realise that's how I felt when we first met -
an uncut key, a smooth blade, edentate,


waiting for your impression, the milling and grooves
of moments in time, until our keyways would fit,
as they finally did in that chapel, our breaths
rising and falling in unison as we listened to the Messiah,
touching at elbow, shoulder and hip

like a pair of Siamese twins sharing one lung.
From then on I was sure we were keyed alike.
That our combinations matched,
our tumblers aligned precisely to give and roll perfectly
into the other's empty spaces.

And at night, when you slept facing away from me
and I held the bow of your hip,
again it was coming home, my stomach, the small of your back,
my knees in the hollows of yours, a master key fit.
So when did the bolt slip? The blade break in the mouth?

Useless now, I understand, to try and unpick the months
back to that second when, for the first time,
one us made a turn that failed to dock,
went nowhere, stuck half-way, leaving us
waiting the expected click, which never came.

So strange then, that we should do this now,
this cutting of keys, just when we're changing all the locks.",https://genius.com/Owen-sheers-keyways-annotated
Muse by Meena Alexander,Meena Alexander,"'Muse' by Meena Alexander is a poem about inspiration and creativity. The poem begins with the speaker describing how, during her youth, she met a young girl who gave her a notebook and provided for her a well of inspiration. As the poem progresses, the poet uses an extended metaphor, coming creativity and her muse to a bird. She stands in front of the mirror (an allusion to self-analysis) and writes in multiple languages, always listening to the girl whispering in her ear.","I was young when you came to me.
Each thing rings its turn,
you sang in my ear, a slip of a thing
dressed like a convent girl--
white socks, shoes,
dark blue pinafore, white blouse.

A pencil box in hand: girl, book, tree--
those were the words you gave me.
Girl was penne, hair drawn back,
gleaming on the scalp,
the self in a mirror in a rosewood room
the sky at monsoon time, pearl slits

In cloud cover, a jagged music pours:
gash of sense, raw covenant
clasped still in a gold bound book,
pusthakam pages parted,
ink rubbed with mist,
a bird might have dreamt its shadow there

spreading fire in a tree maram.
You murmured the word, sliding it on your tongue,
trying to get how a girl could turn
into a molten thing and not burn.
Centuries later worn out from travel
I rest under a tree.

You come to me
a bird shedding gold feathers,
each one a quill scraping my tympanum.
You set a book to my ribs.
Night after night I unclasp it
at the mirror's edge

alphabets flicker and soar.
Write in the light
of all the languages
you know the earth contains,
you murmur in my ear.
This is pure transport.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/muse-3/
Ghosts (Homage to Burial) by Emily Berry,Emily Berry,"Ghosts (Homage to Burial) reflects the voice of Burial, Berry creating a poem that honors both human loss and connection. The poem takes words used by Burial in an interview, then putting them into a longer context. The poem reads like a story, Berry commenting on her own mental state. Berry creates a sense of melancholy, discussing being apart from someone. The physical sensation of missing someone is the key here, Berry exploring loss. The poem then progresses to discussing situations in which she feels unsafe. Following this, images of nature comfort the poet. The final few lines of the poem point towards memory. Being reminded of someone brings them to the forefront of your mind. Yet, Berry suggests that if you try and 'talk about it', they disappear all over again. The interview with Burial can be read here.","You can invest everything in someone. This one feeling chopping you up. Anyone can go into the night. I just want to be gone. I want to be unknown. There’s a storm coming. Euphoria trapped in a vial ... I was once in these mountains, the middle of nowhere. I used to get taken away. A lot of things were wrong, cold things, bad things. The weight of the decisions in you. You’d see these fires. Someone upset on the other side of the world. It’s like a Ouija board, it’s ... the devil’s face in their eyes, that feeling like a ghost touched you, like finding a body in a lift shaft on the other side of the night, even if you fight to see it, you’ll never see anything. I love rain, safe haven. Deserts, forests, people. I just want to be a symbol you alone could hear. Someone in your head. Everyone knows those sorts of feelings. When there’s nowhere to go, tearing through an empty building, the image of where you just were still on your retina. If you talk about it, it just sort of disappears",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/151743/ghosts-homage-to-burial
Among the Rocks by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,"'Among the Rocks' by Robert Browning is an incredible nature lyric that sets an autumnal scene by the shores, and meditates upon one's sufferings and mortality. The poem begins in a romantic fashion depicting a cherishing seaside landscape with rocks, rippling waves, and sea-larks' sweet twitters. With the unfolding of the primary image, Browning's speaker hints at the simple doctrine of human life, which is to accept everything as they come like the firm rocks by the sea. Then digressing from the central image, the speaker talks about her past love. She is of the view that one should try to make their surroundings better by their pain and longings. The suffering in this world is definitely going to help one to get to heaven.","Oh, good gigantic smile o’ the brown old earth,
This autumn morning! How he sets his bones
To bask i’ the sun, and thrusts out knees and feet
For the ripple to run over in its mirth;
Listening the while, where on the heap of stones
The white breast of the sea-lark twitters sweet.

That is the doctrine, simple, ancient, true;
Such is life’s trial, as old earth smiles and knows.
If you loved only what were worth your love,
Love were clear gain, and wholly well for you:
Make the low nature better by your throes!
Give earth yourself, go up for gain above!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43744/among-the-rocks
Old Timers by Carl Sandburg,Carl Sandburg,"'Old Timers' by Carl Sandburg is an original poem about war, conscription, and how history repeats itself. In the first part of the poem, Sandburg begins with his speaker describing himself as a reluctant conscript. He's been brought into one ancient war after another and placed at the disposal of leaders like Xerxes I and Miltiades. He survives each and travels through history and time to the troops (columns) of Napoleon and then Abraham Lincoln. It's not until the final period in time that the man gets injured.","I am an ancient reluctant conscript.

On the soup wagons of Xerxes I was a cleaner of pans.
On the march of Miltiades' phalanx I had a haft and head;
I had a bristling gleaming spear-handle.

Red-headed Cæsar picked me for a teamster.
He said, ""Go to work, you Tuscan bastard,
Rome calls for a man who can drive horses.""

The units of conquest led by Charles the Twelfth,
The whirling whimsical Napoleonic columns:
They saw me one of the horseshoers.

I trimmed the feet of a white horse Bonaparte swept the night stars with.

Lincoln said, ""Get into the game; your nation takes you.""",https://internetpoem.com/carl-sandburg/old-timers-poem/
Expect Nothing by Alice Walker,Alice Walker,"'Expect Nothing' by Alice Walker is a beautiful poem about living life without any expectations of it. 'Expect Nothing' by Alice Walker teaches how to stay happy without expecting anything from life. The expectation is the key to all sufferings. It keeps human beings in a chain of lifelong enslavement. The soul becomes weaker day by day and one day it ceases to exist. That's why Alice Walker says, “Wish for nothing larger/ Than your own small heart”. She tries to save readers from the trap. Discovering the reason why human beings live their lives in utter fear of losing something, will help us to “Live frugally/ on surprise.” On this note, the poet ends the poem.","Expect nothing. Live frugally
On surprise.
Become a stranger
To need of pity
Or, if compassion be freely
Given out
Take only enough.
Stop short of urge to plead
Then purge away the need.
Wish for nothing larger
Than your own small heart
Or greater than a star;
Tame wild disappointment
With caress unmoved and cold.
Make of it a parka
For your soul.

Discover the reason why
So tiny human midget
Exists at all
So scared unwise.
But expect nothing. Live frugally
On surprise.",https://www.blueridgejournal.com/poems/aw-expect.htm
"Dali, Hussain, or Odour of Dream, Colour of Wind by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh",Thangjam Ibopishak Singh,"'Dali, Hussain, or Odour of Dream, Colour of Wind' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh depicts a dream-like sequence of different images that appears in the poet's delirious mind. 'Dali, Hussain, or Odour of Dream, Colour of Wind' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh begins as absurdly as it ends. Likewise, in the first stanza, the poetic persona refers to two different questions, one about the yield and another about the number of poems. Thereafter, the persona sees someone counting a bundle of one-rupee notes in his dream vision. Surprisingly, the cashier eats up the notes. Moreover, in the following stanza, the poet refers to a maxim said by a poet. In the next stanza, the poet asserts his individualism and non-conformist attitude towards society. The fourth stanza is undoubtedly similar to the previous sections. Here, the poet talks about the sound of the gun alongside the scent of flowers. Thereafter, introducing a bunch of images, the poem moves to the ironical reference to the sacred peepal tree. At last, there is a reference to the metamorphosis of the poet's wife.","My uncle from Wangu asked me:
How many bushels of paddy
Have you stored for this season?
I asked my friend Kesho again:
How many kgs of poems have you written for this month?
Write and then tear up, write and then tear up;
A cashier counts old one rupee notes
A rotten, mouldy bundle of notes
One thousand ...
Seven hundred ...
Only eleven ...
Spending one hour two minutes and fifteen seconds.
Then after the final count, washing his hands clean with dettol
He eats up the notes, one by one.
True, the poet says:
Leaves do not move without a fleeting wind.
True, I also say:
Even if the wind blows or not, even if it rains or not,
Leaves never move
If there are no leaves
On the bare tree.
One knows man’s thoughts from his speech
As for the mind’s words of a tight-lipped man
One can read them from his eyes;
That is why to conceal my mind
I put on dark glasses;
Again, so that even the glasses cannot read
I keep my two eyes shut.
(Men who close their eyes can be seen inside a lockup
Or inside a sacred temple).
I’ve never seen fish flying in the sky
But I often saw ducks floating on water.
You say: you are wrong
I say: I am wrong
The Vedas say: ‘In Brahma
Lies zero.’
You also say and I too declare: What they call ‘you’
Is never me.
Which is more fragrant
The report of guns or the scent of flowers?
The sound of guns lies on the nose,
The odour of flowers on the tips of flowers.
Blind men see colours on voices.
A love letter
A horoscope of my grandfather
A radio which belongs to our mother
A pair of tweezers of my son
Ten bottles of rum flying in air
One brassiere which belongs to my grandmother
A pair of lingams
A bird carrying a bunch of keys in its beak
One whistle
Two butterflies
A cake of soap
A Shakespearean sonnet
A pair of clogs
Tied up by women’s hair. (What’s left?
Add some of your own).
An egg
Sinks slowly
Slowly, very slowly...
Piercing my sleeping teenage daughter’s
Hairless pate.
Then her two ears move lazily.
One day, wanting to own a peepal tree
I climbed atop a rich man’s tall building, and,
Entering his bathroom, looked for one.
(I like peepal trees very much;
I would like to see every citizen of Imphal
Walking with a small peepal tree
Growing on his head).
Then inside that bathroom
I found my wife leaning:
Half her body, waist above turning into a peepal
Waist below her body without clothes.
I was not surprised
I was not worried
I did not cry.
Girish Karnad,
My wife metamorphosed into your Chelluvi!
How can I claim now
That I like peepal trees?",https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-6314_DALI-HUSSAIN-OR-ODOUR-OF-DREAM-COLOUR-OF-WIND
The Revenant by Billy Collins,Billy Collins,"In this piece, The Revenant, Billy Collins channels the spirit of a deceased dog and subverts the accepted relationship of man and his best friend. The poet somewhat playfully pokes fun at modern pet owners, and by extension modern people in general, by using the angry spirit of a dog to point out the various indulgent absurdities that they purchase. Throughout The Revenant, and especially after the turn, Collins implies that dogs and other animals have the same spiritual capacity as human beings. It’s possible that the poet is suggesting that dogs even have souls.","I am the dog you put to sleep,

as you like to call the needle of oblivion,

come back to tell you this simple thing:

I never liked you--not one bit.



When I licked your face,

I thought of biting off your nose.

When I watched you toweling yourself dry,

I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.



I resented the way you moved,

your lack of animal grace,

the way you would sit in a chair to eat,

a napkin on your lap, knife in your hand.



I would have run away,

but I was too weak, a trick you taught me

while I was learning to sit and heel,

and--greatest of insults--shake hands without a hand.



I admit the sight of the leash

would excite me

but only because it meant I was about

to smell things you had never touched.



You do not want to believe this,

but I have no reason to lie.

I hated the car, the rubber toys,

disliked your friends and, worse, your relatives.



The jingling of my tags drove me mad.

You always scratched me in the wrong place.

All I ever wanted from you

was food and fresh water in my metal bowls.



While you slept, I watched you breathe

as the moon rose in the sky.

It took all of my strength

not to raise my head and howl.



Now I am free of the collar,

the yellow raincoat, monogrammed sweater,

the absurdity of your lawn,

and that is all you need to know about this place



except what you already supposed

and are glad it did not happen sooner--

that everyone here can read and write,

the dogs in poetry, the cats and the others in prose.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/go9cef/poem_the_revenant_by_billy_collins/
Ascetic by Patrick Kavanagh,Patrick Kavanagh,"Form and Tone 'Ascetic' is written in free verse, meaning that it doesn't fit into any traditional poetry form (like a sonnet for instance) it is separated into three stanzas all of which contain four lines. The meter is uneven and most of the lines differ in length and the number of syllables they contain. Throughout the poem, there is a consistent (-A-A) rhyming pattern. The poem's tone upon first reading seems very morose. It appears to be laden with negativity. Although the middle stanza offers hope it ends on a negative note. However, when read contextually understanding that the poem is about people that choose to lead a poor existence it takes on a slightly different meaning.","That in the end
I may find
Something not sold for a penny
In the slums of Mind.

That I may break
With these hands
The bread of wisdom that grows
In the other lands.

For this, for this
Do I wear
The rags of hunger and climb
The unending stair.",https://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/ascetic.html
A Thank-Offering by Ella Higginson,Ella Higginson,"'A Thank-Offering' by Ella Higginson is a simple poem in which the speaker thanks God for all that he is done. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker uses lyrical language and many examples of imagery to describe their natural world. There are many beautiful sights to behold, all of which day is a tribute to God's creation. They acknowledge that people around them have suffered, but God has always been there to provide the needy with resources. The poem concludes with the speaker thanking God for all he has provided.","Lord God, the winter has been sweet and brief
In this fair land;
For us the budded willow and the leaf,
The peaceful strand.
For us the silver nights and golden days,
The violet mist;
The pearly clouds pierced with vibrating rays
Of amethyst.
At evening, every wave of our blue sea
Hollowed to hold
A fragment of the sunset’s mystery—
A fleck of gold.
The crimson haze is on the alder trees
In places lush;
Already sings with sweet and lyric ease
The western thrush.
Lord God, for some of us the days and years
Have bitter been;
For some of us the burden and the tears,
The gnawing sin.
For some of us, O God, the scanty store,
The failing bin;
For some of us the gray wolf at the door,
The red, within!
But to the hungry Thou hast given meat,
Hast clothed the cold;
And Thou hast given courage strong and sweet
To the sad and old.
And so we thank Thee, Thou most tender God,
For the leaf and flower;
For the tempered winds, and quickening, velvet sod,
And the gracious shower.
Yea, generous God, we thank Thee for this land
Where all are fed,
Where at the doors no freezing beggars stand,
Pleading for bread.",https://poets.org/poem/thank-offering
Sweeney Erect by T.S. Eliot,T.S. Eliot,"Sweeney Erect' by T.S. Eliot introduces one of Eliot's best-known characters, Sweeney, in a brothel alongside an epileptic woman. The poem takes the reader through a turbulent mental and emotional landscape that leads to Sweeney's room in a brothel. There, he is standing at a full-length mirror shaving while the woman he presumably slept with is writhing on the bed. He shows no interest in her suffering and goes about his business as calmly as he can. The poem concludes with other women intervening and trying to revive the woman with smelling salts. ","And the trees about me,
Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks
Groan with continual surges; and behind me
Make all a desolation. Look, look, wenches!
Paint me a cavernous waste shore
Cast in the unstilted Cyclades,
Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks
Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.
Display me Aeolus above
Reviewing the insurgent gales
Which tangle Ariadne's hair
And swell with haste the perjured sails.
Morning stirs the feet and hands
(Nausicaa and Polypheme),
Gesture of orang-outang
Rises from the sheets in steam.
This withered root of knots of hair
Slitted below and gashed with eyes,
This oval O cropped out with teeth:
The sickle motion from the thighs
Jackknifes upward at the knees
Then straightens out from heel to hip
Pushing the framework of the bed
And clawing at the pillow slip.
Sweeney addressed full length to shave
Broadbottomed, pink from nape to base,
Knows the female temperament
And wipes the suds around his face.
(The lengthened shadow of a man
Is history, said Emerson
Who had not seen the silhouette
Of Sweeney straddled in the sun).
Tests the razor on his leg
Waiting until the shriek subsides.
The epileptic on the bed
Curves backward, clutching at her sides.
The ladies of the corridor
Find themselves involved, disgraced,
Call witness to their principles
And deprecate the lack of taste
Observing that hysteria
Might easily be misunderstood;
Mrs. Turner intimates
It does the house no sort of good.
But Doris, towelled from the bath,
Enters padding on broad feet,
Bringing sal volatile
And a glass of brandy neat.",https://allpoetry.com/Sweeney-Erect
Waking in Winter by Sylvia Plath,Sylvia Plath,"Waking in Winter' by Sylvia Plath describes a natural landscape, a hotel, and those who reside there as hopeless and loveless. In the first lines of 'Waking in Winter' the sky is portrayed as hard, cold and slick and the trees are relayed to the reader as “stiff” as if “burnt nerves.” With these descriptions, Plath intended to convey a space that is devoid of feeling— it has all been burnt off. The “nerves” which are responsible for feeling within the human body, are destroyed. In the fourth line, she takes the reader into her dreams and speaks about “destruction, annihilations”. It soon becomes clear that the speaker and a companion are taking a car trip to a resort, but the places they pass are dark, poisoned, and speak of death. Eventually, they get to the resort and the speaker describes skull-like people looking at the views, and emotionless nurses tending to those in residence there. The whole poem feels colorless, loveless, and hopeless. Death is the reigning power in the world Plath has created.","I can taste the tin of the sky —- the real tin thing.
Winter dawn is the color of metal,
The trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves.
All night I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations —-
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you and I
Inching off in the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green
Poison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones,
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the way to the sea resort.

How the balconies echoed! How the sun lit up
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the view!
Space! Space! The bed linen was giving out entirely.
Cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the nurses —-
Each nurse patched her soul to a wound and disappeared.
The deathly guests had not been satisfied
With the rooms, or the smiles, or the beautiful rubber plants,
Or the sea, Hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.",https://allpoetry.com/Waking-In-Winter
The Dash by Linda Ellis,Linda Ellis,"'The Dash' by Linda Ellis is a well-known poem that addresses the brevity of life and the importance of living a good loved-filled one. The poem begins with the speaker describing a speech they heard about. It was given by a man at a funeral who was addressing the life of his deceased friend. He asked everyone there to consider the “dash” in between the friend's birth and death. That, he said, is what really matters. Using this little story as the basis for the poem, the speaker talks to the reader. They ask everyone to consider how they've been living their own dash and if after they've died they would be proud of what they've done.","I read of a man who stood to speak
At the funeral of a friend
He referred to the dates on the tombstone
From the beginning...to the end

He noted that first came the date of birth
And spoke the following date with tears,
But he said what mattered most of all
Was the dash between those years

For that dash represents all the time
That they spent alive on earth.
And now only those who loved them
Know what that little line is worth

For it matters not, how much we own,
The cars...the house...the cash.
What matters is how we live and love
And how we spend our dash.

So, think about this long and hard.
Are there things you'd like to change?
For you never know how much time is left
That can still be rearranged.

If we could just slow down enough
To consider what's true and real
And always try to understand
The way other people feel.

And be less quick to anger
And show appreciation more
And love the people in our lives
Like we've never loved before.

If we treat each other with respect
And more often wear a smile,
Remembering this special dash
Might only last a little while

So, when your eulogy is being read
With your life's actions to rehash...
Would you be proud of the things they say
About how you spent YOUR dash?",https://hellopoetry.com/poem/1184764/the-dash-poem-by-linda-ellis/
She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron,Lord Byron,"Scholars believe that 'She Walks in Beauty' by Lord Byron was written when the poet met his cousin, Mrs. Anne Beatrix Wilmont. The speaker spends the lines celebrating the beauty of one woman. He compares her beauty to night rather than day. The latter is suggested to be “gaudy,” and the “lady” certainly isn't. The speaker describes different aspects of the woman, like her hair and skin. She is the image of peaceful beauty. The woman is unaware of the impact that she's had on the speaker, who is also the poet, by the end of 'She Walks in Beauty.' The speaker is interested in the woman's inner beauty as well as her outer beauty or physical beauty.","She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43844/she-walks-in-beauty
The Little Boy Lost by William Blake,William Blake,"‘The Little Boy Lost’ by William Blake is the story of a young child who while out searching for his father, gets lost in the woods. In this piece the “father” of the boy is getting farther and farther away from him, the child cannot hear or see him. He is without guidance in the dark but after a time of suffering the “vapours” fly away and he is, presumably, able to find his way back. Just as one might for a time lose their faith in God, feel lost in the woods in the search to return to him, and then finally be able to see clearly, so too does the boy overcome his situation.","Father, father, where are you going
O do not walk so fast.
Speak father, speak to your little boy
Or else I shall be lost,

The night was dark no father was there
The child was wet with dew.
The mire was deep, & the child did weep
And away the vapour flew.",https://poemanalysis.com/william-blake/the-little-boy-lost/
White Apples by Donald Hall,Donald Hall,"'White Apples' by Donald Hall uses vivid imagery to describe the speaker's mental state after he lost his father. This short poem creates a grave mood by using symbols and imagery. It consists of a set of images including the “pale closed door,” “white apples,” “taste of stone,” “coat,” and “galoshes”. Each image refers to a particular idea that is integral to the theme. This poem presents a speaker, probably the poet himself, who has lost his father a week ago. One day, he wakes up by hearing the echo of his father's voice. It makes him restless and sad. He looks around him. In each item he stares at contains the hue of death. In the end, he wishes if his father called him again, he would be there at his side.","when my father had been dead a week
I woke
with his voice in my ear
I sat up in bed
and held my breath
and stared at the pale closed door

white apples and the taste of stone

if he called again
I would put on my coat and galoshes",https://poets.org/poem/white-apples
"Folk poet, Ysinno by Lakdasa Wikramasingha",Lakdasa Wikramasingha,"Folk poet, Ysinno' by Lakdasa Wikramasingha describes the plight of the folk poet “Ysinno” and his efforts to roof his newly built bamboo hut. The poem begins with the speaker stating that Ysinno is cutting bamboo to build his family a new home. He is doing all of the work on his own, without help. By the time he has all the “wattles” he needs to construct the house he realizes he doesn't have the straw he needs for the roof. Ysinno travels to the nearby “Walauwa” or manor house and asks the “Menike,” or lady of the house for help. He is told to come back at the end of the next harvest season when he can retrieve the straw he needs. Ysinno is unable to wait that long and tells her so. She is moved by his plight and allows him to take what he needs from behind the shed. It is due to this act of kindness that he and his family survive the season. Her blessing lived on through them.","Ysinno cut the bamboo near Haniketta ,
And from those wattles made his hut
And had nothing to cover it with, nothing
Like a hundred and sixty
Bales of straw.

So he made his way to the Walauva at Iddamalgoda
And to the Menike said how poor he was.
And how from his twenties he had made those lines of song
Swearing before her all his fealties.
So she said, Wait for the Yala
Harvest and take the straw.

Ysinno said, O the rains are coming near,
My woman fretting, her kid will get all wet
Then the kind Menike said, O then
You take what straw you need from the behind shed
And Ysinno being a folk poet and his lines not being all dead ,
The benison of the Menike of Iddamalgoda
Lives even today.",https://e-kalvi.com/from-the-life-of-the-folk-poet-ysinno-by-lakdas-wikkramasinha/l
Arms and the Boy by Wilfred Owen,Wilfred Owen,"'Arms and the Boy' by Wilfred Owen is a disturbing poem that depicts through poignant images of armaments the true nature of war. In the first two stanzas of the poem, the speaker describes the weaponry which a young man is going to have to take up to fight against his prescribed enemies. The bayonet and bullets are personified. They are described as a longing for flesh and as having sharp teeth that are poised to inflict horror on anyone. The final stanza contrasts the previous in that it talks about the boy's nature. He was not built for this destruction. He's young and happy and there's nothing about him that's monstrous or terrible, unlike war itself.","Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade
How cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood;
Blue with all malice, like a madman's flash;
And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh.

Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-leads, 
Which long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads, 
Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth 
Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death.

For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple.
There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple;
And God will grow no talons at his heels,
Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47394/arms-and-the-boy
A Minor Role by U.A. Fanthorpe,U.A. Fanthorpe,"‘A Minor Role’ by U.A. Fanthorpe is a reflection on the role the poet has been forced to play within society due to her illness. There is a fine line between the life the poet wants and the one she has, and this is explored through the constantly changing narrative directions of the poem. Fanthorpe challenges the reader to reflect on their own life, on the role they play, and how they present themselves to society. Although the tone of the poem is overly sardonic, there are flashes of an innate desire to live and to thrive. Fanthorpe seems to be caught in a purgatory of wanting more and finding out how to live as she is.","I’m best observed on stage,
Propping a spear, or making endless
Exits and entrances with my servant’s
patter, Yes, sir. O no, sir. If I get
These midget moments wrong, the monstrous fabric
Shrinks to unwanted sniggers.

But my heart’s in the unobtrusive,
The waiting-room roles: driving to hospitals,
Parking at hospitals. Holding hands under
Veteran magazines; making sense
Of consultants’ monologues; asking pointed
Questions politely; checking dosages,
Dates; getting on terms with receptionists;
Sustaining the background music of civility.
At home in the street you may see me
Walking fast in case anyone stops:
getting on, getting better my formula
For well-meant intrusiveness.

At home,
Thinking ahead: Bed? A good idea!
(Bed solves a lot); answer the phone,
Be wary what I say to it, but grateful always;
Contrive meals for hunger-striker; track down
Whimsical soft-centred happy-all-the-way-through novels;
Find the cat (mysteriously reassuring);
Cancel things; pretend all’s well,
Admit it’s not. Learn to conjugate all the genres of misery:
Tears, torpor, boredom, lassitude, yearnings
For a simpler illness, like a broken leg.
Enduring ceremonial delays. Being referred
Somewhere else. Consultant’s holiday. Saying Thank you,
For anything to everyone
Not the star part.

And who would want it? I jettison the spear,
The servant’s try, the terrible drone of Chorus:
Yet to my thinking this act was ill advised
It would have been better to die*. No it wouldn’t!
I am here to make you believe in life.",https://genius.com/U-a-fanthorpe-a-minor-role-annotated
The Darkling Thrush by Thomas Hardy,Thomas Hardy,"‘The Darkling Thrush’ is typical of Thomas Hardy’s work in that it shows life on Earth, human as well as animal, existing under the iron grip of an unsympathetic force, in this case, Nature. ‘The Darkling Thrush’ is typical of Hardy’s work in that it shows life on Earth, human as well as animal, existing under the iron grip of an unsympathetic force, in this case, Nature. In praising defiance and the unconquerable spirit, it is also typical, and in its firm unwillingness to state a clear conclusion, balancing hope and pessimism, it could stand for Hardy’s poems and novels. The musing tone, use of natural imagery to create and represent human moods and feelings, and the simple rhyme scheme are unobtrusive and powerful.","I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre-grey,
And Winter's dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day.
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
Had sought their household fires.
The land's sharp features seemed to be
The Century's corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,
The wind his death-lament.
The ancient pulse of germ and birth
Was shrunken hard and dry,
And every spirit upon earth
Seemed fervourless as I.
At once a voice arose among
The bleak twigs overhead
In a full-hearted evensong
Of joy illimited;
An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,
In blast-beruffled plume,
Had chosen thus to fling his soul
Upon the growing gloom.
So little cause for carolings
Of such ecstatic sound
Was written on terrestrial things
Afar or nigh around,
That I could think there trembled through
His happy good-night air
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew
And I was unaware.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/44325/the-darkling-thrush
35/10 by Sharon Olds,Sharon Olds,"'35/10' by Sharon Olds is about a mother/daughter relationship. The latter is starting to become a woman while the former is going grey and getting more wrinkles and folds. In the first lines of this piece, the speaker describes brushing her daughter's hair. She compares it to her own and describes herself as a servant, standing behind her daughter as she grows more beautiful. She sees the changes happening in her daughter's body and recognizes how they juxtapose with those happening in her own. Furthermore, she's getting old, and her daughter is becoming a woman. The speaker sees how her daughter is going to replace her in the world. She's going to be the woman the speaker is now and once was.","Brushing out my daughter’s dark
silken hair before the mirror
I see the gray gleaming on my head,
the silver-haired servant behind her. Why is it
just as we begin to go
they begin to arrive, the fold in my neck
clarifying as the fine bones of her
hips sharpen? As my skin shows
its dry pitting, she opens like a small
pale flower on the tip of a cactus;
as my last chances to bear a child
are falling through my body, the duds among them,
her full purse of eggs, gold and
firm as hard-boiled yolks, is about
to snap its clasp. I brush her tangled
fragrant hair at bedtime. It’s an old
story—the oldest we have on our planet—
the story of replacement.",https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mqr/2016/04/from-the-archive-3510-by-sharon-olds/
Base Details by Siegfried Sassoon,Siegfried Sassoon,"Base Details follows this same line of criticism. It is a short, scathing poem about the inadequacy of British leadership during the First World War, and an indictment of the same system that allowed underqualified men into positions where they commanded great numbers of troops. It is well worth remembering that higher ranks were only available to men of some means and money who could afford to buy the uniform; therefore, the British army was primarily composed of the poor at the bottom, and the rich at the top, where the rich were mostly useless at leading troops.","If I were fierce, and bald, and short of breath
I'd live with scarlet Majors at the Base,
And speed glum heroes up the line to death.
You'd see me with my puffy petulant face,
Guzzling and gulping in the best hotel,
Reading the Roll of Honour. ""Poor young chap,""
I'd say — ""I used to know his father well;
Yes, we've lost heavily in this last scrap.""
And when the war is done and youth stone dead,
I'd toddle safely home and die — in bed.",https://allpoetry.com/Base-Details
The Funeral by Norman Dubie,Norman Dubie,"'The Funeral' by Norman Dubie is about the story of a speaker and his aunt who was suffering from cancer. This poem introduces the main characters at the very beginning of the poem. The speaker is a four-year-old child who nostalgically recapitulates about his aunt. She was his youngest aunt, and they had a close relationship. The summer before, they spend time together near their springhouse. Then his aunt told her how they made butter from organic materials. Unfortunately, he was unaware of the fact that she was suffering from cancer, and she died the following March.","It felt like the zero in brook ice.
She was my youngest aunt, the summer before
We had stood naked
While she stiffened and giggled, letting the minnows
Nibble at her toes. I was almost four—
That evening she took me
To the springhouse where on the scoured planks
There were rows of butter in small bricks, a mold
Like ermine on the cheese,
And cut onions to rinse the air
Of the black, sickly-sweet meats of rotting pecans.

She said butter was colored with marigolds
Plucked down by the marsh
With its tall grass and miner’s-candles.
We once carried the offal’s pail beyond the barn
To where the fox could be caught in meditation.
Her bed linen smelled of camphor. We went

In late March for her burial. I heard the men talk.
I saw the minnows nibble at her toe.
And Uncle Peter, in a low voice, said
The cancer ate her like horse piss eats deep snow.",https://radicalhope.wordpress.com/2016/12/02/the-funeral-by-norman-dubie/
The Women Gather by Nikki Giovanni,Nikki Giovanni,"'The Women Gather' is a short free verse poem that speaks on how we judge one another and the essentially good nature of human beings. The poem begins with the speaker describing horrible times of tragedy, such as a death, “women gather” together for moral support. Together they are able to help one another through difficulties. The speaker continues to describe a number off different types of people who, themselves, can cause tragedy. She speaks on the hypocrites who pray the loudest in church, and those who present to be “humane” but never act on it. She is dismayed by diplomats who promote war and the fact that sometimes the old must bury the young. While all of these things are awful, they are abominations. They do not occur so often that the world cannot be changed. She then asks the reader how one is able to judge a man when anyone could have a secret life. She answers the question by stating that “We” must judge by understanding good intentions, even if the result aren't what the person wanted or was hoping for. We must come together and help one another in times of stress and learn to comfort when it is needed. Hope must be passed on. Through these changes we make to ourselves we will be able to find goodness within negative situations. It will exist like an “unburnt” picture pulled from ashes.","The women gather because it is not unusual to seek comfort in our hours of stress.
A man must be buried.
It is not unusual that the old bury the young though it is an abomination.
It is not strange that the unwise and the ungentle carry the banner of humaneness though it is a castration of the spirit.
It no longer shatters the intellect that those who make war call themselves diplomats.
We are no longer surprised that the unfaithful pray loudest every Sunday in church and sometimes in rooms facing east though it is a sin and a shame.
So how do we judge a man.
Most of us love from our need to love not because we find someone deserving.
Most of us forgive because we have trespassed not because we are magnanimous.
Most of us comfort because we need comforting, our ancient rituals demand that we give what we hope to receive.
And how do we judge a man.
We learn to greet when meeting, to cry when parting and to soften our words at times of stress.
The women gather with cloth and ointment, their busy hands bowing to laws that decree willows shall stand swaying but unbroken against even the determined wind of death.
We judge a man by his dreams, not alone his deeds.
We judge a man by his intent, not alone his shortcomings.
We judge a man because it is not unusual to know him through those who love him.
The women gather strangers to each other because they have loved a man.
It is not unusual to sift through ashes and find an unburnt picture…",https://aaregistry.org/poem/the-women-gather-for-joe-strickland-by-nikki-giovanni/
On the one-ton temple bell by Taniguchi Buson,Haiku Poems,"'On the one-ton temple bell' by Taniguchi Buson is a short haiku that describes a moonmoth sitting on a “one ton temple bell.” The poem is only three lines long, as traditional haikus are. In the first line, the speaker describes a one-ton temple bell. This brings in religious allusions and should inspire the reader to consider the sound the bell might make if it's rung. It could ring, one might feel, at any moment. In contrast to the pending sound is the moonmoth. It sits on the bell, unmoving and unperturbed by the possibility that it might be disturbed violently in the near future. It is “folded into sleep.”","On the one-ton temple bell
a moon-moth, folded into sleep,

The Slave’s Lament by Robert Burns,Robert Burns,"'The Slave's Lament', a poem written by Robert Burns, presents a Senegalese slave's lamentation after being captured and deported to Virginia. In this poem, there are a total of three sections. Each section presents a set of images to create a contrast. In the first stanza, the poet refers specifically to the shore of Senegal that the slave has seen while being ransacked of freedom. Secondly, Burns presents a distinction between the nature of both the lands, Senegal and Virginia. Thereafter, in the last stanza, the poet highlights how the slave misses his family, friends, and happy memories. However, the speaker of the poem is not agitated. He is rather wary. The cause is nothing other than the loss of freedom.","It was in sweet Senegal that my foes did me enthral,
For the lands of Virginia,-ginia, O:
Torn from that lovely shore, and must never see it more;
And alas! I am weary, weary O:
Torn from that lovely shore, and must never see it more;
And alas! I am weary, weary O.

All on that charming coast is no bitter snow and frost,
Like the lands of Virginia,-ginia, O:
There streams for ever flow, and there flowers for ever blow,
And alas! I am weary, weary O:
There streams for ever flow, and there flowers for ever blow,
And alas! I am weary, weary O:

The burden I must bear, while the cruel scourge I fear,
In the lands of Virginia,-ginia, O;
And I think on friends most dear, with the bitter, bitter tear,
And alas! I am weary, weary O:
And I think on friends most dear, with the bitter, bitter tear,
And alas! I am weary, weary O:",http://www.robertburns.org/works/371.shtml
Fee-fi-fo-fum,A List of Popular Nursery Rhymes,"Origins 'Fee-fi-fo-fum' is the name of a humorous and interesting chant from the story “Jack the Giant Killer.” The rhyme, 'Fee-fi-fo-fum,' is best-known from its original publication in “Jack the Giant Killer.” This is a Cornish fairy tale that tells the story of a young man who kills numerous giants during the reign of King Arthur. Giants, a common symbol and character in Cornish stories, were well worth defeating. The tune, which is chanted by a giant in the story, is incredibly well-known today. It was even referenced by William Shakespeare in King Lear. He wrote these lines, spoken by Edgar: Child Roland to the dark tower came,His word was still “Fie, foh, and fum,I smell the blood of a British man.” The story originally appeared in a chapbook in 1711. The plot was later used in a text published in 1760 by John Cotton and Joshua Eddowes. It's unclear though where exactly this story originated from. Some suggest it could date back as early as the 1100s, in one form or another. There are some similarities between this tale and Norse Mythology, such as the various miniature series within the longer tale of his life. Scholars have also noted the magical objects he acquires as interesting related features. Specifically, scholars have cited a story called “The Herd-boy and the Giant” as a similar tale in addition to “Tom Thumb,” a story from Norse myth.","Fee! Fie! Foe! Fum!
I smell the blood of an Englishman.
Be he 'live, or be he dead,
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.",https://wordsforlife.org.uk/activities/fee-fie-foe-fum/
Nobody Knows You When You’re Down and Out by Jimmie Cox,Jimmie Cox,"‘Nobody Knows You When You’re Down and Out’ by Jimmie Cox is simple, yet profound. It is one that speaks of wealth, poverty, and friendship. The speaker in this poem experiences the loss of all that he once had. He loses his wealth, his luxuries, and his friends. Out of all that he lost, he feels the loss of his friends most acutely. The poem reveals the heart of the speaker in that he cares for other human beings more than he cares for money. The reason that he misses his money, is because he could treat his friends and be surrounded by people. His despair in losing his money and his friends can be read as both a warning and a comfort.","Once I lived the life of a millionaire.
Spending my money; I didn't care.
I took all my friends out for a good time,
Buyin' high price liquor, champagne and wine.

When I began to fall so low, I didn't have a friend,
and no place to go.
If I ever get hold of a dollar again,
Gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins.
This song was originally posted on protestsonglyrics.net

Nobody knows you,
When you're down and out.
In you pocket, not one penny.
And your friends, you don't have any.

But if you ever get on your feet again,
Then you'll find your long lost friends.
It's mighty strange, without a doubt.
Nobody knows you when your down and out,
I mean when you're down and out.",http://www.protestsonglyrics.net/Great_Depression_Songs/Nobody-Knows-You-Down-Out.phtml
A Hope Carol by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"'A Hope Carol' by Christina Rossetti describes a liminal space in which the speaker is existing and the phenomenological elements of life which inspire her to hope for the future. Each of the poem's eight-line sections begins with describing a liminal, or in-between, space in which the speaker exists. In the first, she is between night and day, the second, between the stars and moon, and finally, in the third, between today and tomorrow. Within each one of these spaces, she is confronted by a sound that reminds her of something she “longs” for. Voices are calling and sound reverberating, falling, and rising around her. These noises remind her of her birds and the sounds of minstrels playing music. 'A Hope Carol' concludes with the speaker's final acceptance of the fact that her future, and all the things she most desires, may come today, or “may be” tomorrow. She knows she can't control the world and is willing to wait to get what she wants the most.","A night was near, a day was near;
Between a day and night
I heard sweet voices calling clear,
Calling me:
I heard a whirr of wing on wing,
But could not see the sight;
I long to see my birds that sing,--
I long to see.
Below the stars, beyond the moon,
Between the night and day,
I heard a rising falling tune
Calling me:
I long to see the pipes and strings
Whereon such minstrels play;
I long to see each face that sings,--
I long to see.
To-day or may be not to-day,
To-night or not to-night;
All voices that command or pray,
Calling me,
Shall kindle in my soul such fire,
And in my eyes such light,
That I shall see that heart's desire
I long to see.",https://hellopoetry.com/poem/15977/a-hope-carol/
Mississipi by Aimé Césaire,Aimé Césaire,"Glossary of Words in Mississipi Before we can dig into the symbolism of Mississipi (which you can read here), we must first examine its literal meaning. Some of the words within this poem are quite challenging, so I've defined them for you here to allow for better comprehension: munificence: the quality of being munificent, or showing unusual generosity reticule: a small purse or bag, originally of the network but later of silk, rayon, etc. flagrant: blazing, burning, or glowing (this word has multiple definitions. The one that applies to this poem is considered archaic, meaning that while this word was used for this purpose in the past, it isn't used to mean this now) ferocity: a ferocious quality or state; savage fierceness geranium: This is typically used to describe a type of flower, but in this context, it refers to a vivid red color","Too bad for you men who don’t notice that my eyes remember
slings and black flags
which murder with each blink of my Mississipi lashes

Too bad for you men who do not see who do not see anything
not even the gorgeous railway signals formed under my eyelids by the black and red discs
of the coral snake that my munificence coils in my Mississipi tears

Too bad for you men who do not see that in the depth of the reticule where chance has
deposited our Mississipi eyes
there waits a buffalo sunk to the very hilt of the swamp’s eyes

Too bad for you men who do not see that you cannot stop me from building to his fill
egg-headed islands of flagrant sky
under the calm ferocity of the immense geranium of our sun.",https://www.guernicamag.com/mississipi/
Where the Mind is Without Fear by Rabindranath Tagore,Rabindranath Tagore,"This poem is a contemplation of a state of being, a place in time, and a way of living into which the author, Tagore, wishes his country, India, would awaken. The first nine lines of the poem present a number of statements that begin with the word, “Where…” These statements are each positive attributes that Tagore is hoping India will achieve. The poem resolves by finishing all of these sentences, and Tagore makes a plea to his Father, for his country to wake up into “that heaven of freedom.” In this poem, Tagore lays out the tenants of what could be called a utopian society.","Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.",https://allpoetry.com/where-the-mind-is-without-fear
Invictus by William Ernest Henley,William Ernest Henley,"In this poem, the speaker is faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Throughout it all, however, he perseveres and is successful in his endeavors. He faces each challenge with courage and is not afraid, and he can surmount any hardship. “In the fell clutch of circumstance” or “Under the bludgeonings of chance,” he has not bowed his head. However, he knows at some point in time; one has to enter the horrid palace of death.

But, it shall find the speaker unafraid. It does not matter to him how narrow the gate to heaven is. Neither the “punishments” inscribed on the “scroll” makes him frightened. It is his self-belief and courage that will sail him through all the difficulties.","Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus
The Land of the Half-Humans by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh,Thangjam Ibopishak Singh,"'The Land of the Half-Humans' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh talks about an imaginary land inhabited by humans living six months with heads and the rest with bodies. 'The Land of the Half-Humans' by Thangjam Ibopishak Singh talks about a place similar to any Indian state where humans live with heads for six months and the rest of the year with only their bodies. That's why those peculiar humans go on eating, drinking, and talking for the first six months. In the rest of the year, the “half-body” performs working, laboring, and shitting. The women of this land have well-proportioned bodies and unlike men, they give birth through their mouths. According to the poet, this land inhabited by nameless half-humans is always in the news. The poet isn't sure why the land is so famous as it is just like any other democratic state of India.","For six months just head without body, six months just body without head, has anyone
seen a land inhabited by these people?
No? I have; it’s not a folktale; I’ve not only seen but have been to that land.
For six months to talk and to eat is their job; like a millstone grinding. The following six
months Bhima gorging and Shakuni suffering; for the headless body only shitting is its
share. The head talks, eats, drinks; just talking, eating, drinking. While the body is
working, laboring, shitting; work, labor, shit. To sweat, to be bone-weary. In the land of
the half- body.
Do women live in that land? What does the species of women look like?
There are women; there are children. The same goes for women too, half-and-half body.
They have long hair like the women of our land. They are big, tall, buxom, broad and
well- proportioned. As for clothes, they hang them below the waist. The law of the land
does not permit a body hidden by clothes. When the body dwells for six months it is
springtime for them. (Since the bodies are headless when the men and the women meet,
they are not fastidious). The head-only gives birth within six months. Besides talking and
eating the mouths of the women also deliver babies. The women have more attributes
than the men do. That is why the women have no teeth. God created them with ingenuity.
When the head walks, its two broad, fanlike ears, spread wide and it flies like a bird,
beating its wings. When they speak, we can comprehend their language; they speak the
language of men. But when the headless body speaks, a voice that no stranger can
recognize emits from an orifice of the body. This voice is also accompanied by an odor.
A land such as this one is in the news; a land much talked about. The moon shines at
night; the sun shines in the afternoon. There is no predicament of poverty; dearth of food
and clothes is unknown. Some men even surpass Kuber. And the earnings of the body’s
sweat of six months, the six month-old head eats up with a vengeance.
There are political rights; a government is set up in the land. Democracy functions with
total success. An election is held every five years. But for the people in this land there
are no names. So for the nameless citizens the nameless representatives govern the land
of the half-humans. Because whether to give human names to the head or to the body —
no one can decide. A land such as this is very much in the news, a land much talked
about.",poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-6318_THE-LAND-OF-THE-HALF-HUMANS
The Great Lover by Rupert Brooke,Rupert Brooke,"The Great Lover' by Rupert Brooke contains a speaker's profession of love for his past partners and a wide range of objects and experiences. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has been a “great…lover.” A reader will soon come to understand that this refers to intimate partners as well as experiences. First, he takes the time to describe how his love is at night brighter than any other star in the sky. Anyone who saw it would remember it and pass on their astonishment at its brilliance. The speaker goes on to state that he has loved many things and wants to write their names on a banner and wave it in the wind. This way they will always be remembered. In the next lines he lists out a great number of objects and experiences he has seen and had in his life. These range from “blue-massing clouds” and “furs to touch” to “footprints in the dew” and pools of water. Although the speaker has spent the first two-thirds of the poem bragging on the variety of things he loves, the mood changes in the last section. Here, he tries to come to terms with the fact that he is going to lose everything in his life when he dies. When he passes into the realm of death all the “loves” of his life will abandon him. They will become “faithless” and remain on earth. He is saddened by this prospect but also somewhat cheered as he knows he'll find new loves wherever he ends up. His parting gift to his past life is that his “loves” will be known by all to be splendid.","I have been so great a lover: filled my days
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,
Desire illimitable, and still content,
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,
My night shall be remembered for a star
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see
The inenarrable godhead of delight?
Love is a flame:—we have beaconed the world's night.
A city:—and we have built it, these and I.
An emperor:—we have taught the world to die.
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,
And set them as a banner, that men may know,
To dare the generations, burn, and blow
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming . . . .
These I have loved:
White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
The good smell of old clothes; and other such—
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers
About dead leaves and last year's ferns. . . .
Dear names,
And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;—
All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust
And sacramented covenant to the dust.
——Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,
And give what's left of love again, and make
New friends, now strangers. . . . But the best I've known
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown
About the winds of the world, and fades from brains
Of living men, and dies.
Nothing remains.
O dear my loves, O faithless, once again
This one last gift I give: that after men
Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,
Praise you, 'All these were lovely'; say, 'He loved.'",https://poets.org/poem/great-lover
Knocking Around by John Ashbery,John Ashbery,"'Knocking Around' by John Ashbery is a complex poem about the duality of life, its pros, and cons, as well as the way that “you” live it. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker uses the first-person perspective to suggest that they are seeking a change in their life, looking for a way to abate the “soft storms of life and “rest secure.” As the poem progresses, the speaker describes the ways that human beings look back on the past and reframe it in a new way. They specifically cite the tulip mania in Holland and the Art Deco movement. In the following lines, the speaker continues to discuss the ways that human beings consider the ups and downs of life. Ashbery uses a very interesting simile to compare the positives and negatives of life to the high and low tides in the ocean. Even though the ocean looks different, it is still the same ocean, just as life is the same no matter if it feels positive or negative. These lights and darks, like day and night, depending on one another. The poem concludes with several more image-rich and interesting statements about the nature of life and the way that people choose to live it.","I really thought that drinking here would
Start a new chain, that the soft storms
Would abate, and the horror stories, the
Noises men make to frighten themselves,
rest secure on the lip as a canyon as day
Died away, and they would still be there the next morning.
Nothing is very simple.
You must remember that certain things die out for awhile
So that they can be remembered with affection
Later on and become holy. Look at Art Deco
For instance or the ""tulip mania"" of Holland:
Both things we know about and recall
With a certain finesse as though they were responsible
For part of life. And we congratulate them.
Each day as the sun wends its way
Into your small living room and stays
You remember the accident of night as though it were a friend.
All that is forgotten now. There are no
Hard feelings, and it doesn't matter that it will soon
Come again. You know what I mean. We are wrapped in
What seems like a positive, conscious choice, like a bird
In air. It doesn't matter that the peonies are tipped in soot
Or that a man will come to station himself each night
Outside your house, and leave shortly before dawn,
That nobody answers when you pick up the phone.
You have all lived through lots of these things before
And know that life is like an ocean: somethimes the tide is out
And sometimes it's in, but it's always the same body of water
Even though it looks different, and
It makes the things on the shore look different.
They depend on each other like the snow and the snowplow.
It's only after realizing this for a long time
That you can make a chain of events like days
That more and more rapidly come to punch their own number
Out of the calendar, draining it. By that time
Space will be a jar with no lid, and you can live
Any way you like out on those vague terraces,
Verandas, walkways-- the forms of space combined with itme
We are allowed, and we live them passionately,
Fortunately, though we can never be described
And would make lousy characters in a novel.",https://vantheman.blogspot.com/2004/02/three-poems-by-john-ashbery-triplet-of.html
Ma Rainey by Sterling A. Brown,Sterling A. Brown,"Ma Rainey' by Sterling A. Brown describes the charismatic effect Ma Rainey has on her fans and how everyone can relate to her songs. The first part of the poem describes how folks from miles away come to town just to attend a Ma Rainey show. People from Cape Girardeau to Poplar Bluff travel for miles down to New Orleans in motorcars and mules to listen to her songs. The second part describes the scene before she comes on stage. Folks from all walks of life gather there and sit patiently for her to come before them. Her songs, perhaps her emotions, can travel directly to their hearts as she speaks in their language and sings their unlucky tales. In the final section, the narrator talks about one fellow, who once listened to Ma Rainey singing “Backwater Blues.” He could say nothing much except how she just gets hold of them in some kind of way.","When Ma Rainey

Fear no more the heat o’ the sun by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"Fear no more the heat o' the sun' by William Shakespeare is a fairly simple song about death taken from the tragedy Cymbeline. In the lines of the poem/song, the two speakers go through all the reasons that the listeners, who can't actually hear them, should be glad their dead. They are rid of all work, jobs, and responsibilities that the real world would demand of them. They also don't have to worry about punishments from those in power or following any set of rules. There is also a repetition of the fact that everyone, no matter their beauty, power, or age will find death.","Fear no more the heat o’ the sun,
Nor the furious winter’s rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages:

Fear no more the frown o’ the great;
Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak:
The scepter, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

Fear no more the lightning flash,
Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone;
Fear not slander, censure rash;
Thou hast finished joy and moan:
All lovers young, all lovers must
Consign to thee, and come to dust.

Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Nothing ill come near thee!

Epitaph by Merrit Malloy,Merrit Malloy,"Epitaph' by Merrit Malloy is a thoughtful poem that conveys a speaker's wishes after they pass away. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by telling the listener/s that they want their life and death to do as much good for the world as possible. This means that their body should be given away to those who need it, as well as their memory utilized in the best way. The speaker wants the listener to consider the love they shared and rather than mourn it, use it to better the world. The speaker doesn't want anyone to cry for them. Instead, people should cry for and pay attention to those who are still alive and suffering. Turn to them and use whatever energy “you” have to improve their lives. ","When I die
Give what’s left of me away
To children
And old men that wait to die.
And if you need to cry,
Cry for your brother
Walking the street beside you.
And when you need me,
Put your arms
Around anyone
And give them
What you need to give to me.

I want to leave you something,
Something better
Than words
Or sounds.

Look for me
In the people I’ve known
Or loved,
And if you cannot give me away,
At least let me live on in your eyes
And not on your mind.

You can love me most
By letting
Hands touch hands,
By letting
Bodies touch bodies,
And by letting go
Of children
That need to be free.

Love doesn’t die,
People do.
So, when all that’s left of me
Is love,
Give me away.

I’ll see you at home
In the earth.",https://www.tumblr.com/apoemaday/184875633104/epitaph
A Season in Hell: Bad Blood by Arthur Rimbaud,Arthur Rimbaud,"'A Season in Hell: Bad Blood' by Arthur Rimbaud is the second of nine sections that make up Rimbaud's long, complex, and deeply metaphorical poem. Throughout this poem, the speaker bounces from experience to experience. The running theme throughout is that of dissatisfaction. He expresses his anger with his lineage and his desire to get away from his ancestors. The speaker does not want to be part of the “inferior” French race and continually states that he's going to run away. But, this doesn't make him happy, even when he's mentally able to do so. He's still invisible to the world—an outsider.","spaceFrom my ancestors the Gauls I have pale blue eyes, a narrow brain, and awkwardness in competition. I think my clothes are as barbaric as theirs. But I don't butter my hair.

The Gauls were the most stupid hide-flayers and hay-burners of their time.

From them, I inherit: idolatry, and love of sacrelige; - oh! all sorts of vice, anger, lechery, - terrific stuff, lechery; - lying, above all, and laziness.

I have a horror of all trades and crafts. Bosses and workers, all of them peasants, and common. The hand that holds the pen is as good as the one that holds the plow. - What a century for hands! - I'll never learn to use my hands. And then, domesticity goes too far. The propriety of beggary shames me. Criminals are as disgusting as men without balls: I'm intact, and I don't care.

But! who has made my tongue so treacherous, that until now it has counseled and kept me in idleness? I have not used even my body to get along. Out-idling the sleepy toad, I have lived everywhere. There's not one family in Europe that I don't know. - Families, I mean, like mine, who owe their existence to the Declaration of the Rights of Man. - I have known each family's eldest son!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If only I had a link to some point in the history of France!

But instead, nothing.

I am well aware that I have always been of an inferior race. I cannot understand revolt. My race has never risen, except to plunder: to devour like wolves a beast they did not kill.

I remember the history of France, the Eldest Daughter of the Church. I would have gone, a village serf, crusading to the Holy Land; my head is full of roads in the Swabian plains, of the sight of Byzantium, of the ramparts of Jerusalem; the cult of Mary, the pitiful thought of Christ crucified, turns in my head with a thousand profane enchantments. - I sit like a leper among broken pots and nettles, at the foot of a wall eaten away by the sun. - And later, a wandering mercenary, I would have bivouacked under German nighttimes.

Ah! one thing more: I dance the Sabbath in a scarlet clearing, with old women and children.

I don't remember much beyond this land, and Christianity. I will see myself forever in its past. But always alone; without a family; what language, in fact, did I used to speak? I never see myself in the councils of Christ; nor in the councils of the Lords, - Christ's representatives.

What was I in the century past: I only find myself today. The vagabonds, the hazy wars are gone. The inferior race has swept over all - the People, as they put it, Reason; Nation and Science.

Ah, Science! Everything is taken from the past. For the body and the soul, - the last sacrament, - we have Medicine and Philosophy, household remedies and folk songs rearrainged. And royal entertainments, and games that kings forbid! Geography, Cosmography, Mechanics, Chemistry!...

Science, the new nobility! Progress. The world moves!... And why shouldn't it?

We have visions of numbers. We are moving toward the Spirit. What I say is oracular and absolutely right. I understand, and since I cannot express myself except in pagan terms, I would rather keep quiet.

Pagan blood returns! The Spirit is at hand, why does Christ not help me, and grant my soul nobility and freedom. Ah! but the Gospel belongs to the past! The Gospel! The Gospel.

I wait gluttinously for God. I have been of an inferior race for ever and ever.

And now I am on the beaches of Brittany. Let cities light their lamps in the evening. My daytime is done; I am leaving Europe. The air of the sea will burn my lungs; lost climates will turn my skin to leather. To swim, to pulverize grass, to hunt, above all to smoke; to drink strong drinks, as strong as molten ore, - as did those dear ancestors around their fires.

I will come back with limbs of iron, with dark skin, and angry eyes: in this mask, they will think I belong to a strong race. I will have gold: I will be brutal and indolent. Women nurse these ferocious invalids come back from the tropics. I will become involved in politics. Saved.

Now I am accursed, I detest my native land. The best thing is a drunken sleep, stretched out on some strip of shore.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

But no one leaves. - Let us set out once more on our native roads, burdened with my vice, that vice that since the age of reason has driven roots of suffering into my side - that towers to heaven, beats me, hurls me down, drags me on.

Ultimate innocence, final timidity. All's said. Carry no more my loathing and treacheries before the world.

Come on! Marching, burdens, the desert, boredom and anger.

Hire myself to whom? What beasts adore? What sacred images destroy? What hearts shall I break? What lie maintain? - Through what blood wade?

Better to keep away from justice. - A hard life, outright stupor, - with a dried-out fist to lift the coffin lid, lie down, and suffocate. No old age this way, no danger: terror is very un-French.

- Ah! I am so forsaken I will offer at any shrine impulses toward perfection.

Oh my self-denial, my marvelous Charity! my Selfless love! And still here below!

De Profundis Domine, what an ass I am!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

When I was still a little child, I admired the hardened convict on whom the prison door will always close; I used to visit the bars and the rented rooms his presence had consecrated; I saw with his eyes the blue sky and the flower-filled work of the fields; I followed his fatal scent through city streets. He had more strength than the saints, more sense than any explorer - and he, he alone! was witness to his glory and his rightness.

Along the open road on winter nights, homeless, cold, and hungry, one voice gripped my frozen heart: ""Weakness or strength: you exist, that is strength. You don't know where you are going or why you are going, go in everywhere, answer everyone. No one will kill you, any more than if you were a corpse."" In the morning my eyes were so vacant and my face so dead, that the people I met may not even have seen me.

In cities, mud went suddenly red and black, like a mirror when a lamp in the next room moves, like treasure in the forest! Good luck, I cried, and I saw a sea of flames and smoke rise to heaven; and left and right, all wealth exploded like a billion thunderbolts.

But orgies and the companionship of women were impossible for me. Not even a friend. I saw myself before an angry mob, facing a firing squad, weeping out sorrows they could not understand, and pardoning! - like Joan of Arc! - ""Priests, professors and doctors, you are mistaken in delivering me into the hands of the law. I have never been one of you; I have never been a Christian; I belong to the race that sang on the scaffold; I do not understand your laws; I have no moral sense; I am a brute; you are making a mistake...""

Yes, my eyes are closed to your light. I am an animal, a nigger. But I can be saved. You are fake niggers; maniacs, savages, misers, all of you. Businessman, you're a nigger; judge, you're a nigger; general, you're a nigger; emperor, old scratch-head, you're a nigger: you've drunk a liquor no one taxes, from Satan's still. - This nation is inspired by fever and cancer. Invalids and old men are so respectable that they ask to be boiled. - The best thing is to quit this continent where madness prowls, out to supply hostages for these wretches. I will enter the true kingdom of the sons of Cham.

Do I understand nature? Do I understand myself? No more words. I shroud dead men in my stomach.... Shouts, drums, dance, dance, dance! I can't even imagine the hour when the white men land, and I will fall into nothingness.

Thirst and hunger, shouts, dance, dance, dance!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The white men are landing. Cannons! Now we must be baptized, get dressed, and go to work.

My heart has been stabbed by grace. Ah! I hadn't thought this would happen!

But I haven't done anything wrong. My days will be easy, and I will be spared repentance. I will not have had the torments of the soul half-dead to the Good, where austure light rises again like funeral candles. The fate of a first-born son, a premature coffin covered with shining tears. No doubt, perversion is stupid, vice is stupid; rottenness must always be cast away. But the clock must learn to strike more than hours of pure pain! Am I to be carried away like a child, to play in paradise, forgetting all this misery!

Quick! Are there any other lives? - Sleep for the rich is impossible. Wealth has always lived openly. divine love alone confers the keys of knowledge. I see that nature is only a show of kindness. Farewell chimeras, ideals and errors.

The reasonable song of angels rises from the rescue ship: it is divine love. - Two loves! I may die of earthly love, die of devotion. I have left behind creatures whose grief will grow at my going! You choose me from among the castaways, aren't those who remain my friends?

Save them!

I am reborn in reason. The world is good. I will bless life. I will love my brothers. There are no longer childhood promises. Nor the hope of escaping old age and death. God is my strength, and I praise God.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Boredom is no longer my love. Rage, perversion, madness, whose every impulse and disaster I know, - my burden is set down entire. Let us appraise with clear heads the extent of my innocence.

I am no longer able to ask for the consolation of a beating. I don't imagine I'm off on a honeymoon with Jesus Christ as my father-in-law.

I am no prisoner of my own reason. I have said: God. I want freedom within salvation: how shall I go about it? A taste for frivolity has left me. No further need for divine love or for devotion to duty. I do not regret the age of emotion and feeling. To each his own reason, contempt, Charity: I keep my place at the top of the angelic ladder of good sense.

As for settled happiness, domestic or not... no, I can't. I am too dissipated, too weak. Work makes life blossom, an old idea, not mine; my life doesn't weigh enough, it drifts off and floats far beyond action, that third pole of the world.

What an old maid I'm turning into, to lack the courage to love death!

If only God would grant me that celestial calm, etherial calm, and prayer, - like the saints of old. - The Saints! They were strong! Anchorites, artists of a kind we no longer need!

Does this farce have no end? My innocence is enough to make me cry. Life is the farce we all must play.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Stop it! this is your punishment. - Forward march!

Ah! my lungs burn, my temples roar! Night rolls in my eyes, beneath this sun! My heart... my arms and legs...

Where are we going? To battle? I am weak! the others go on ahead. Tools, weapons... give me time!...

Fire! Fire at me! Here! or I'll give myself up. - Cowards! - I'll kill myself! I'll throw myself beneath the horses' hooves!

Ah!...

- I'll get used to it.

That would be the French way, the path of honor!",https://www.mag4.net/Rimbaud/poesies/Blood.html
Song of the Flower by Kahlil Gibran,Kahlil Gibran,"Song of the Flower' by Kahlil Gibran describes what living in the world as a flower involves, from sunrises to perpetual optimism. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the poem is not being narrated from the perspective of a human being. If one does not consider the title, the identity of the speaker is a mystery at first. The poem will provide a great amount of context through its text which will eventually bring one to the correct conclusion. The speaker is talking through the voice of a flower. The first stanzas describe when it is flowers are most active and beneficial to the world. They spreads their fragrances through the air and help to announce the sunrise alongside the birds. The second half of the poem speaks on how flowers are used for different occasions. The speaker says that “I am…” used in a range of objects and events, alongside the living and the dead. In the final lines the flower-speaker asserts an opinion that humankind needs to look to flowers for advice on how to face the world optimistically. ","I am a kind word uttered and repeated
By the voice of Nature;
I am a star fallen from the
Blue tent upon the green carpet.
I am the daughter of the elements
With whom Winter conceived;
To whom Spring gave birth; I was
Reared in the lap of Summer and I
Slept in the bed of Autumn.


At dawn I unite with the breeze
To announce the coming of light;
At eventide I join the birds
In bidding the light farewell.


The plains are decorated with
My beautiful colors, and the air
Is scented with my fragrance.


As I embrace Slumber the eyes of
Night watch over me, and as I
Awaken I stare at the sun, which is
The only eye of the day.


I drink dew for wine, and hearken to
The voices of the birds, and dance
To the rhythmic swaying of the grass.


I am the lover's gift; I am the wedding wreath;
I am the memory of a moment of happiness;
I am the last gift of the living to the dead;
I am a part of joy and a part of sorrow.


But I look up high to see only the light,
And never look down to see my shadow.
This is wisdom which man must learn.",https://allpoetry.com/Song-Of-The-Flower------XXIII
A Slumber did my Spirit Seal by William Wordsworth,William Wordsworth,"'A Slumber did my Spirit Seal' by William Wordsworth tells of a speaker's realization that his beloved is not immune to the ravages of time. The poem begins with the speaker describing how up until now his “spirit” had been sealed off. His mind and soul had been protected from the realization that his love, Lucy, was going to be subject to aging, just like everyone else. Because he never actively acknowledged this fact he lived without “human fears.” His lack of fear made him unprepared for the shock of reality when his love died. It had seemed to him, while she was still alive, and his spirit was in that trance-like state, that Lucy could not “feel / The touch of earthly years.” Time could not affect her as it does everyone else. This illusion was shattered. The second stanza of the poem speaks of this realization. His love now has “no motion” or forced to move through the world with. Additionally, time and death have taken her sight and hearing from her. Aging has done to her what it does to every other living thing and she has become a true part of the earth. Just as the “rocks, and stones, and trees” change with time, so now, the speaker sees, does Lucy.","A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears:
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years.
No motion has she now, no force;
She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
With rocks, and stones, and trees.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45553/a-slumber-did-my-spirit-seal
Moonshine by Richard Murphy,Richard Murphy,"Moonshine' by Richard Murphy is a direct and poignant poem that discusses the implications of being in love and being alone. Throughout the four simple stanzas of the poem, the speaker explores two different, contrasting, ways of being. One can either be alone or they can be together with another person. The speaker makes it clear throughout the following lines that when he's alone he'd rather be with the person he loves and when he's with that person he'd rather be alone.","To think
I must be alone:
To love
We must be together.

I think I love you
When I’m alone
More than I think of you
When we’re together.

I cannot think
Without loving
Or love
Without thinking.

Alone I love
To think of us together:
Together I think
I’d love to be alone.",https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-10482_MOONSHINE
Flash Crimson by Carl Sandburg,Carl Sandburg,"'Flash Crimson' by Carl Sandburg describes a speaker's immovable faith in the divine, his talents, and, most importantly, the permanence of virtues. In the poem 'Flash Crimson,' Sandburg begins with a pleading commentary on the hardships a speaker desires in life. He indirectly renounces all worldly desires and vanity. In his statements, the speaker's assurance seems to come from his conviction that his afterlife will be the best of the best. Sandburg also explains that regardless of a person's death, their legacy, deeds, kindness, and memories will remain on earth forever.","I SHALL cry God to give me a broken foot.

I shall ask for a scar and a slashed nose.

I shall take the last and the worst.

I shall be eaten by gray creepers in a bunkhouse where no runners of the sun come and no dogs live.

And yet-of all 'and yets' this is the bronze strongest-



I shall keep one thing better than all else; there is the blue steel of a great star of early evening in it; it lives longer than a broken foot or any scar.

The broken foot goes to a hole dug with a shovel or the bone of a nose may whiten on a hilltop-and yet-'and yet'-



There is one crimson pinch of ashes left after all; and none of the shifting winds that whip the grass and none of the pounding rains that beat the dust, know how to touch or find the flash of this crimson.

I cry God to give me a broken foot, a scar, or a lousy death.

I who have seen the flash of this crimson, I ask God for the last and worst.",https://internetpoem.com/carl-sandburg/flash-crimson-poem/
The God Called Poetry by Robert Graves,Robert Graves,"The God Called Poetry' by Robert Graves talks about the nature of poetry and how one can master this art to be a poet. This poem compares poetry to God. The poet has started to know at last that what he tries to measure is something great hence immeasurable. With the help of poetry, he can leap higher than he ever thought before. The poet thinks poetry was there even before the creation as if it is God who made this whole universe. Thereafter the poet goes on to describe the nature of poetry. Comparing it to the Greek god Janus, he says it has two heads conjoined together. One face symbolizes creation and another destruction just like God. If the speaker wants to be a poet he has to establish a balance between the two qualities in poetry. ","Now I begin to know at last,
These nights when I sit down to rhyme,
The form and measure of that vast
God we call Poetry, he who stoops
And leaps me through his paper hoops
A little higher every time.
Tempts me to think I’ll grow a proper
Singing cricket or grass-hopper
Making prodigious jumps in air
While shaken crowds about me stare
Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder
To fly up on my master’s shoulder
Rustling the thick stands of his hair.
He is older than the seas,
Older than the plains and hills,
And older than the light that spills
From the sun’s hot wheel on these.
He wakes the gale that tears your trees,
He sings to you from window sills.
At you he roars, or he will coo,
He shouts and screams when hell is hot,
Riding on the shell and shot.
He smites you down, he succours you,
And where you seek him, he is not.
To-day I see he has two heads
Like Janus—calm, benignant, this;
That, grim and scowling: his beard spreads
From chin to chin: this god has power
Immeasurable at every hour:
He first taight lovers how to kiss,
He brings down sunshine after shower,
Thunder and hate are his also,
He is YES and he is NO.
The black beard spoke and said to me,
‘Human fraility though you be,
Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!
They’ll obey you in the end:
Hill and field, river and marsh
Shall obey you, hop and skip
At the terrour of your whip,
To your gales of anger bend.’
The pale beard spoke and said in turn
‘True: a prize goes to the stern,
But sing and laugh and easily run
Through the wide airs of my plain,
Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,
And draw my creatures with soft song;
They shall follow you along
Graciously with no doubt or pain.’
Then speaking from his double head
The glorious fearful monster said
‘I am YES and I am NO,
Black as pitch and white as snow,
Love me, hate me, reconcile
Hate with love, perfect with vile,
So equal justice shall be done
And life shared between moon and sun.
Nature for you shall curse or smile:
A poet you shall be, my son.’",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54012/the-god-called-poetry
"Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward by John Donne",John Donne,"Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward' by John Donne describes a speaker's spiritual transformation and fear of confronting God on Good Friday. The poem begins with the speaker describing how the human soul exists within one sphere and the physical world another. He states that most people spend all their time in the latter. This poem is the moment when the speaker, and the poet himself, decides to turn to the spiritual side of life. In the following lines he imagines what it would be like to observe the crucifixion and admits to himself that he doesn't have the strength to do so. This is a source of shame for the speaker who wants to become close to God, still he is unable to even face the image in his head. By the end of the poem, he asks God to punish him for his weakness and therefore grant him the strength to look at death.","Let mans Soule be a Spheare, and then, in this,
The intelligence that moves, devotion is,
And as the other Spheares, by being growne
Subject to forraigne motion, lose their owne,
And being by others hurried every day,
Scarce in a yeare their naturall forme obey:
Pleasure or businesse, so, our Soules admit
For their first mover, and are whirld by it.
Hence is't, that I am carryed towards the West
This day, when my Soules forme bends toward the East.
There I should see a Sunne, by rising set,
And by that setting endlesse day beget;
But that Christ on this Crosse, did rise and fall,
Sinne had eternally benighted all.
Yet dare I'almost be glad, I do not see
That spectacle of too much weight for mee.
Who sees Gods face, that is selfe life, must dye;
What a death were it then to see God dye?
It made his owne Lieutenant Nature shrinke,
It made his footstoole crack, and the Sunne winke.
Could I behold those hands which span the Poles,
And tune all spheares at once peirc'd with those holes?
Could I behold that endlesse height which is
Zenith to us, and our Antipodes,
Humbled below us? or that blood which is
The seat of all our Soules, if not of his,
Made durt of dust, or that flesh which was worne
By God, for his apparell, rag'd, and torne?
If on these things I durst not looke, durst I
Upon his miserable mother cast mine eye,
Who was Gods partner here, and furnish'd thus
Halfe of that Sacrifice, which ransom'd us?
Though these things, as I ride, be from mine eye,
They'are present yet unto my memory,
For that looks towards them; and thou look'st towards mee,
O Saviour, as thou hang'st upon the tree;
I turne my backe to thee, but to receive
Corrections, till thy mercies bid thee leave.
O thinke mee worth thine anger, punish mee,
Burne off my rusts, and my deformity,
Restore thine Image, so much, by thy grace,
That thou may'st know mee, and I'll turne my face.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44103/good-friday-1613-riding-westward
Love Among the Ruins by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,"'Love Among the Ruins' by Robert Browning is a complicated Victorian poem that uses an extended metaphor to discuss love. In the first lines of 'Love Among the Ruins,' the speaker describes walking in a field and how in that field, sheep roam where a great city used to stand. It's all collapsed now, with nothing remaining but a single turret. This one turret comes to symbolize the city (which the speaker imagines in detail) throughout the poem. The city was filled with sin, greed, lust, and the desire to attain power at any cost. It's gone now, something the speaker sees as a good thing, and has been replaced by a natural, quiet landscape. He imagines a woman in the turret waiting for him and contracts their quiet love against what used to take place in the tower. The poem concludes with the speaker determining that “Love is best.”","Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,
Miles and miles
On the solitary pastures where our sheep
Half-asleep
Tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop
As they crop—
Was the site once of a city great and gay,
(So they say)
Of our country's very capital, its prince
Ages since
Held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far
Peace or war.

Now the country does not even boast a tree,
As you see,
To distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills
From the hills
Intersect and give a name to, (else they run
Into one)
Where the domed and daring palace shot its spires
Up like fires
O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall
Bounding all
Made of marble, men might march on nor be prest
Twelve abreast.

And such plenty and perfection, see, of grass
Never was!
Such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads
And embeds
Every vestige of the city, guessed alone,
Stock or stone—
Where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe
Long ago;
Lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame
Struck them tame;
And that glory and that shame alike, the gold
Bought and sold.

Now—the single little turret that remains
On the plains,
By the caper overrooted, by the gourd
Overscored,
While the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks
Through the chinks—
Marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time
Sprang sublime,
And a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced
As they raced,
And the monarch and his minions and his dames
Viewed the games.

And I know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve
Smiles to leave
To their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece
In such peace,
And the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey
Melt away—
That a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair
Waits me there
In the turret whence the charioteers caught soul
For the goal,
When the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb
Till I come.

But he looked upon the city, every side,
Far and wide,
All the mountains topped with temples, all the glades'
Colonnades,
All the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,—and then
All the men!
When I do come, she will speak not, she will stand,
Either hand
On my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace
Of my face,
Ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech
Each on each.

In one year they sent a million fighters forth
South and North,
And they built their gods a brazen pillar high
As the sky
Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force—
Gold, of course.
O heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!
Earth's returns
For whole centuries of folly, noise and sin!
Shut them in,
With their triumphs and their glories and the rest!
Love is best.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43763/love-among-the-ruins
Blame not my Lute! by Sir Thomas Wyatt,Sir Thomas Wyatt,"'Blame not my Lute!' by Sir Thomas Wyatt implores the lady not to blame Wyatt's metaphorical lute which represents his verse. 'Blame not my Lute!' by Sir Thomas Wyatt talks about not blaming the poet's lute if its sound reminds the lady of her passivity for the poet. The lute, being an instrument, sounds how the user uses it. Therefore, it will be the lady's mistake if she thinks the lute itself is making such heart-wrenching sounds. However, the poet makes it clear why he uses his lute in such a manner. The lady who has broken his heart is the sole cause for giving birth to the spiteful emotions in the poet's naive heart. Moreover, the poet is giving an exact answer to the lady's cruel response. At last, the poet tells the lady to rectify her arrogance to change the tune of the poet's verse. Apart from that, if she likes the poet's songs, she can blush expressing her true feelings for the poet and his works.","BLAME not my Lute ! for he must sound
Of this or that as liketh me ;
For lack of wit the Lute is bound
To give such tunes as pleaseth me ;
Though my songs be somewhat strange,
And speak such words as touch thy change,
Blame not my Lute !
My Lute ! alas ! doth not offend,
Though that perforce he must agree
To sound such tunes as I intend,
To sing to them that heareth me ;
Then though my songs be somewhat plain,
And toucheth some that use to feign,
Blame not my Lute !
My Lute and strings may not deny
But as I strike they must obey ;
Break not them then so wrongfully,
But wreak thyself some other way ;
And though the songs which I indite
Do quit thy change with rightful spite,
Blame not my Lute !
Spite asketh spite, and changing change,
And falsèd faith must needs be known ;
The fault so great, the case so strange ;
Of right it must abroad be blown :
Then since that by thine own desart
My songs do tell how true thou art,
Blame not my Lute !
Blame but thyself that hast misdone,
And well deservèd to have blame ;
Change thou thy way, so evil begone,
And then my Lute shall sound that same ;
But if 'till then my fingers play,
By thy desert their wonted way,
Blame not my Lute !
Farewell ! unknown ; for though thou break
My strings in spite with great disdain,
Yet have I found out for thy sake,
Strings for to string my Lute again :
And if, perchance, this sely rhyme
Do make thee blush, at any time,
Blame not my Lute !",https://www.luminarium.org/renlit/blamenot.htm
Lioness Asleep by Babette Deutsch,Babette Deutsch,"“Lioness Asleep” by Babette Deutsch tells of the plight of a captive lioness whose only escape is through her dreams. The poem begins with the lioness entering an intensely realistic dream after having eaten. The meal has sent her a few moments of bliss in which she imagines herself dozing in the desert of Africa. It is there that she is able to live the life that she wants. It is not clear in the first stanza that she is actually living in an enclosure, this twist is revealed in the second stanza. It begins with the image of the bars of her cage, and the onlookers, vanishing as the lioness sinks deeper into her dreams. There, she is able to forget about the sawdust that acts as her bedding and ignore the fleas that attack her. This dream soon lifts though and she is only left with the memory of the bliss she experienced. This desire for this pleasure is so great that if she could, she would “bound” at this “freedom” and drink it “like blood.” She would, if she was able, put her whole heart into attaining freedom.","Content that now the bleeding bone be swept
Out of her reach, she lay upon her side.
In a blonde void sunk deep, she slept, she slept
Bland as a child, slept, breathing like a bride.
Color of noons that shimmer as they sing
Above the dunes, her sandy flanks heaved slow.
Between her paws curled inward, billowing
Waves of desert silence seemed to flow.

The crowd was gone, the bars were gone, the cage
Thinned into air, the sawdust and the fleas
Winnowed by sleep to nothing. After food,
Absence possessed her: bliss keener than rage,
If slumber’s prisoner at a bound could seize
This ghostly freedom, lapping it like blood.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43441/lioness-asleep
Forties Flick by John Ashbery,John Ashbery,"In 'Forties Flick,' John Ashbery describes the unique setting of the classic 1940s film noir in order to express his nostalgia regarding those crime dramas. This poem portrays the claustrophobic interiors, oblique and vertical lines (especially in regards to lights and shadows), and urban environments of the American film noir. Ashbery describes these things by using the images of “Venetian blind on the painted wall,” “Shadows of the snake-plant and cacti, the plaster animals,” etc. Another unique characteristic of the black and white classic crime dramas that he depicts in the poem is the infamous femme fatale in the line “In bra and panties she sidles to the window.” Ashbery also critiques the movie genre by saying that they have similar endings: “Why must it always end this way?” According to him, several still and silent scenes in the library or of the telephone are lost in the plot and signify little. Whatsoever, Ashbery also appreciates the artistic skills it takes to make those films, i.e., to leave out specific details and to maintain the air of secrecy and mystery, which was crucial for these movies.","The shadow of the Venetian blind on the painted wall,
Shadows of the snake-plant and cacti, the plaster animals,
Focus the tragic melancholy of the bright stare
Into nowhere, a hole like the black holes in space.
In bra and panties she sidles to the window:
Zip! Up with the blind. A fragile street scene offers itself,
With wafer-thin pedestrians who know where they are going.
The blind comes down slowly, the slats are slowly tilted up.
Why must it always end this way?
A dais with woman reading, with the ruckus of her hair
And all that is unsaid about her pulling us back to her, with her
Into the silence that night alone can’t explain.
Silence of the library, of the telephone with its pad,
But we didn’t have to reinvent these either:
They had gone away into the plot of a story,
The “art” part—knowing what important details to leave out
And the way character is developed. Things too real
To be of much concern, hence artificial, yet now all over the page,
The indoors with the outside becoming part of you
As you find you had never left off laughing at death,
The background, dark vine at the edge of the porch.",https://ashberyhouse.yale.edu/forties-flick
Love After Love by Derek Walcott,Derek Walcott,"Love After Love by Derek Walcott is a poem, made up of four stanzas, that is presented in the form of a person offering advice to someone who is distressed. Within those four stanzas, readers can infer that the distress comes from a bad relationship that either has ended or should end and that the person hearing this advice is still suffering from the sadness of the experience. Regardless, Walcott assures this person—this “you”—that not only will things get better, but that the overall state of things will improve in the wake of this relationship. The reason for this seems to be the main theme of the poem as the speaker insists, again and again, that who this person has become does not accurately represent who they truly are, but one day, their true self will return. On that day, they will be happy again since only in embracing who they are can they fully be content.","The time will come
when, with elation
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror
and each will smile at the other's welcome,

and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you

all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,

the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life.",https://allpoetry.com/love-after-love
The Glove and the Lions by Leigh Hunt,Leigh Hunt,"'The Glove and the Lions' by Leigh Hunt describes the dangerous games of love that are played in the royal court of the king, and the consequences of going too far. The poem begins with the speaker describing the event that the royal court, the king included, are attending. It is a fight between two lions and all are there to see it play out. The king himself, Francis, is a fan of this particular “sport,” but his attention is split. He is amazed by the brutality of the fight and the fact that he is able to observe it from safety. On the other hand, he is distracted by the beauty of one for whom he “sighs.” She is the lover of another lord. The lady herself is distracted by the valor of the king and decided to set a task for her lover. She drops her glove into the lion pit in the hopes that he will jump in and retrieve it for her. He does just this but is not pleased with her actions. He throws her glove in her face and leaves the arena. He does not believe that any true lover would set “such a task.”","King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,
And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;
The nobles filled the benches, and the ladies in their pride,
And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed:
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,
Valour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.
Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another;
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother;
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air;
Said Francis then, ""Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there.""
De Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous lively dame
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seemed the same;
She thought, the Count my lover is brave as brave can be;
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me;
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;
I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine.
She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;
He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild:
The leap was quick, return was quick, he has regained his place,
Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face.
""By God!"" said Francis, ""rightly done!"" and he rose from where he sat:
""No love,"" quoth he, ""but vanity, sets love a task like that.""",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44434/the-glove-and-the-lions
All Ye Joyful by J.R.R. Tolkien,J.R.R. Tolkien,"All Ye Joyful' by J.R.R. Tolkien is a joyous poem that celebrates the return to Rivendell of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins after his journey to Erebor. Sung by the elves, this poem is uplifting. Tolkien uses natural imagery to create a lovely scene. The elves sing for the return of their friend, asking that all join in in the festivities. There is dancing and singing. In the third and fourth stanzas everything quiets down and it's time to allow Bilbo to get some rest.","Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together!
The wind's in the tree-top, the wind's in the heather;
The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,
And bright are the windows of night in her tower.

Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together!
Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!
The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;
Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting.

Sigh no more pine, till the wind of the morn!
Fall Moon! Dark be the land!
Hush! Hush! Oak, ash and thorn!
Hushed by all water, till dawn is at hand!",https://allpoetry.com/All-Ye-Joyful
Atlantic City Waiter by Countee Cullen,Countee Cullen,"'Atlantic City Waiter' by Countee Cullen is a thoughtful poem about a waiter's experience working in Atlantic City and his history. The poem begins by describing the way a waiter moves. He's observed, like a majestic animal, by the men and women in the restaurant. But, he maintains a cold exterior. Underneath that is a broad and proud history that could only come from thousands of years of influence from the jungle.","With subtle poise he grips his tray
Of delicate things to eat;
Choice viands to their mouths half way,
The ladies watch his feet
Go carving dexterous avenues
Through sly intricacies;
Ten thousand years on jungle clues
Alone shaped feet like these.
For him to be humble who is proud
Needs colder artifice;
Though half his pride is disavowed,
In vain the sacrifice.
Sheer through his acquiescent mask
Of bland gentility,
The jungle flames like a copper cask
Set where the sun strikes free.",https://poets.org/poem/atlantic-city-waiter
To Winter by Claude McKay,Claude McKay,"Claude McKay's 'To Winter' is a poem expressing the narrator's appreciation of nature. The poem begins with the narrator begging the winter to stay. The next few lines of the poem describe all the signs of the coming spring; the days grow longer and warmer, animals begin to stir, and the land begins to come back to life. The narrator states that he knows what all these signs mean and that he knows that spring has arrived. He then again begs winter to stay and begins describing his homeland. He states that he fled a tropical landscape, where it is always hot and palm trees grow. His familiarity with this kind of climate makes him yearn for the calm cold months.","Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows!
There is a subtle sweetness in the sun,
The ripples on the stream’s breast gaily run,
The wind more boisterously by me blows,
And each succeeding day now longer grows.
The birds a gladder music have begun,
The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun,
From maple’s topmost branch the brown twig throws.
I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean:
I know that thou art making ready to go.
Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green
Always, and palms wave gently to and fro,
And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen,
To ease my heart of its impassioned woe.",https://poets.org/poem/winter-3
"Green Grow the Rushes, O",A List of Popular Nursery Rhymes,"'Green Grow the Rushes, O' is a complicated and interesting poem that uses counting to help young singers/readers understand information from the Bible and about astronomy. The poem starts with twelve and counts down to one. The twelve apostles are the first part of the Bible referenced. Then, the poem goes on to talk about those who went to heaven, the ten commandments, and more. There are far more obscure references, perhaps to the planets and star clusters, midway through the poem. Finally, it concludes with an allusion to the “one,” which most readers take to mean God.","I'll sing you one, O

The City by C. P. Cavafy,C. P. Cavafy,"The City by C. P. Cavafy begins by focusing on the speech of 'You', Cavafy directly quoting from the person he is talking to. This person, although unknown, could be Cavafy talking directly to himself, trying to snap out of the rhetoric that tell him to simply run form his problems. The first stanza of the poem sets out what is going on, with the quoted speaker deciding that his mind has gone soft living in the city he does, seeking escape. The speaker suggests that it is not their fault that their years have been wasted, putting the blame onto the city that they live within. The second stanza of the poem replies to the speaker of the first, undoing this ridiculous notion. Cavafy suggests that it is not the city that has lead to this 'waste' of life, but rather the speaker themselves having wasted their time. Changing the city will not change the mindset of this person, with Cavafy suggesting that they must instead alter their outlook on life for anything to change. Again, change comes from within, it is not something you can force through a radical change of locations. ","You said: “I’ll go to another country, go to another shore,
find another city better than this one.
Whatever I try to do is fated to turn out wrong
and my heart lies buried like something dead.
How long can I let my mind moulder in this place?
Wherever I turn, wherever I look,
I see the black ruins of my life, here,
where I’ve spent so many years, wasted them, destroyed them totally.”

You won’t find a new country, won’t find another shore.
This city will always pursue you.
You’ll walk the same streets, grow old
in the same neighborhoods, turn gray in these same houses.
You’ll always end up in this city. Don’t hope for things elsewhere:
there’s no ship for you, there’s no road.
Now that you’ve wasted your life here, in this small corner,
you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the world.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51295/the-city-56d22eef2f768
Geriatric Ward by Phoebe Hesketh,Phoebe Hesketh,"'Geriatric Ward' by Phoebe Hesketh discusses the geriatric healthcare system and compares it to a cold prison for the old. The poem takes the reader through “feeding time” in the geriatric ward of a hospital and the opinions of doctors and nurses. The speaker depicts the residents of the ward as cabbages and mindless cells at which they blow oxygen. She very clearly sees this period in one's life as torturous and purposeless. The speaker advocates, in varying degrees of authenticity, for an end to prolonged life.","Feeding time in the geriatric ward;
I wondered how they found their mouths,
and seeing that not one looked up, inquired
‘Do they have souls?’ ‘If I had a machine-gun,’ answered the doctor
‘I’d show you dignity in death instead of living death.

Death wasn’t meant to be kept alive.
But we’re under orders
to pump blood and air in after the mind’s gone.
I don’t understand souls;
I only learned about cells
law-abiding as leaves
withering under frost.
But we, never handing over
to mother who knows best,
spray cabbages with oxygen, hoping for a smile,
count pulses of breathing bags whose direction is lost,
and think we’ve won.

Here’s a game you can’t win –
One by one they ooze away in the cold.
There’s no society forbidding
this dragged-out detention of the old-",https://edthemanicstreetpreacher.wordpress.com/tag/phoebe-hesketh/
Rubbish At Adultery By Sophie Hannah,Sophie Hannah,"Form and Tone The poem is separated into four stanzas. Each stanza contains six lines. The line length is similar throughout the poem but the amount of syllables varies from line to line giving the poem a stilted feel, this possibly helps to represent the up and down nature of having an affair. The subject of the poem is comedic but it's really a black comedy. The tone, therefore, is light hearted but a little shocking in places. Rhyme is used throughout the poem and this helps to emphasize the humorous nature of the poem. The rhyme pattern for the first two stanzas utilizes end rhymes every other line (-A-A-A) but in the final stanza, it appears to be (ABABAB) although some of the rhymes throughout are half-rhymes.","Must I give up another night
To hear you whinge and whine
About how terribly grim you feel
And what a dreadful swine
You are? You say you’ll never leave
Your wife and children. Fine;

When have I ever asked you to?
I’d settle for a kiss.
Couldn’t you, for an hour or so,
Just leave them out of this?
A rare ten minutes off from guilty
Diatribes—what bliss.

Yes, I’m aware you’re sensitive:
A tortured, wounded soul.
I’m after passion, thrills, and fun.
You say fun takes its toll,
So what are we doing here? I fear
We’ve lost our common goal.

You’re rubbish at adultery.
I think you ought to quit.
Trouble is, at fidelity
You’re also slightly shit.
Choose one and do it properly
You stupid, stupid git.",https://www.everseradio.com/rubbish-at-adultery-by-sophie-hannah/
Whoso List to Hunt by Sir Thomas Wyatt,Sir Thomas Wyatt,"'Whoso List to Hunt' by Sir Thomas Wyatt talks about the impossibility of getting the love of a lady in one's life by using the metaphor of a “hind”. 'Whoso List to Hunt' by Sir Thomas Wyatt is a sonnet that talks about a hind that is impossible to be captured. In the first section or octave, the poet refers to his mental state after following the hind before. It was a fruitless venture that he undertook. Neither he nor others can catch it. The poet became so exhausted that he says it was like catching air with a net. It soon becomes evident the deer is a woman and the speaker: one of her suitors. However, in the sestet, the poet provides the reason. Here, he says why the hind can't be caught. As it belongs to Caesar, a likely reference to Henry VIII and already his property. So, those who are trying to catch it, can't own the creature.","Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,
But as for me, hélas, I may no more.
The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
I am of them that farthest cometh behind.
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore
Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,
Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.
Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
As well as I may spend his time in vain.
And graven with diamonds in letters plain
There is written, her fair neck round about:
Noli me tangere, for Caesar's I am,
And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.","https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45593/whoso-list-to-hunt-i-know-where-is-an-hind#:~:text=Sir%20Thomas%20Wyatt-,Whoso%20list%20to%20hunt%2C%20I%20know%20where%20is%20an%20hind,them%20that%20farthest%20cometh%20behind."
Once More Unto The Breach (Henry V) by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"Henry gives his men a stark choice: either summon the energy to push through the breach or give up, die and leave it to be filled with the corpses of the “English dead.” He reminds them that there is no room for the “modest stillness and humility” that might be useful in peacetime. Instead, they must “imitate the action of the tiger” and make themselves think and look physically terrifying, by using their full height, baring their teeth, and flaring their nostrils. He advises them to make their eyes look like a “brass cannon” peaking out from a warship and to hold their foreheads high and “fearfully” so they appear like an angry cliff or “galled rock” over the ocean. In the second part of the 'Once more unto the breach' speech, Henry flatters his men, the “noblest English” and urges them to “Dishonour not your mothers” and make their families proud of them by being “men of grosser blood” who are ready for war. By the time the speech ends, the soldiers are ready to storm Harfleur and charge through its walls on Henry's famous rallying cry, “God for Harry, for England and St George!”","Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:

And along the trampled edges of the street

Sprouting despondently at area gates.

And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts

And vanishes along the level of the roofs.",https://poets.org/poem/morning-window
"May You Sleep A Million Years, Shiva by Anita Nair",Anita Nair,"Form and Tone May You Sleep A Million Years, Shiva is interesting in so much as it is divided up into five separate sections, or stanzas, but each of these numbered sections appears to be subdivided into two further sections. Each of the stanzas is eight lines long. There is no pattern in line length or amount of syllables used giving the poem an uneven meter. The poem has quite an angry tone. It is full of emotions as the narrator addresses Shiva who is one of Hinduism'se most prominent and important deities.","I

The Walrus and the Carpenter by Lewis Carroll,Lewis Carroll,"The Walrus and the Carpenter' by Lewis Carroll contains the unusual story of a walk down the beach and the characters that take it. The poem begins with the Walrus and his companion the carpenter mourning the presence of so much sand on the beach. They cry over it, unable to come up with a good way to get rid of it. As quickly as their tears began they stop and begin speaking with some oysters. These oysters walk with them, although they do not have legs, down the beach. They pause, decide to have a discussion, and then decide to eat. It is at this point that there is a change in the poem and it is revealed that the two tricked the oysters into coming with them in order to eat them. They distract them the best they can and then eat them all before they remember to apologize.","""The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done —
""It's very rude of him,"" she said,
""To come and spoil the fun.""
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead —
There were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
If this were only cleared away,'
They said, it would be grand!'
If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
That they could get it clear?'
I doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.
O Oysters, come and walk with us!'
The Walrus did beseech.
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head —
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat —
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more —
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.
The time has come,' the Walrus said,
To talk of many things:
Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —
Of cabbages — and kings —
And why the sea is boiling hot —
And whether pigs have wings.'
But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed —
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'
But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
The night is fine,' the Walrus said.
Do you admire the view?
It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf —
I've had to ask you twice!'
It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
The butter's spread too thick!'
I weep for you,' the Walrus said:
I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.
O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none —
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.""",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43914/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter-56d222cbc80a9

They are part of the story and are therefore asked to consider themselves within the same situation as the intended listener. The speaker describes how this person reached a point in their life when they knew “what they had to do”. Voices follow this person, trying to get them to return to the past and focus on them instead. But, this listener does not give in. They continue to move forward and brave the uneven path that is set out before them. The speaker states that it was “already late enough”. The listener had wasted enough of their life paying attention to the voices. Now there is no time to spare in moving into the new world. Once the old voice has dissipated, “you” were able to hear a new voice. It took a moment to realize that this voice was “your own”. The listener moves away from the world they knew, and “deeper and deeper” into a new one. The only thing they have on their mind at this point is to save their own life.","One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
though the voices around you
kept shouting
their bad advice --
though the whole house
began to tremble
and you felt the old tug
at your ankles.
""Mend my life!""
each voice cried.
But you didn't stop.
You knew what you had to do,
though the wind pried
with its stiff fingers
at the very foundations,
though their melancholy
was terrible.
It was already late
enough, and a wild night,
and the road full of fallen
branches and stones.
But little by little,
as you left their voice behind,
the stars began to burn
through the sheets of clouds,
and there was a new voice
which you slowly
recognized as your own,
that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper
into the world,
determined to do
the only thing you could do --
determined to save
the only life that you could save.",http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_thejourney.html
To a Mouse by Robert Burns,Robert Burns,"To a Mouse' by Robert Burns describes the unfortunate situation of a mouse whose home was destroyed by the winter winds. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he knows about the nature of the mouse. It is small and scared of the presence of humans. The speaker understands why this is the case and sympathizes. He goes on to describe the winds which destroyed the mouse's labored over home and how it is now without shelter for the winter. In the final lines, he relates the mouse's predicament to that experienced by all of humankind. One's plans are liable to go awry, no matter how hard one plans for the future.","Wee, sleeket, cowran, tim’rous beastie,
O, what a panic’s in thy breastie!
Thou need na start awa sae hasty,

I’m truly sorry Man’s dominion
Has broken Nature’s social union,
An’ justifies that ill opinion,
Which makes thee startle,
At me, thy poor, earth-born companion,

The Glory of the Garden by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling,"'The Glory of the Garden' by Rudyard Kipling describes England through the extended metaphor of a well-loved, well-cared-for garden. The poem begins with the speaker describing England as a garden with “stately views”. It has beautiful shrubs and peacocks, but there are also tool sheds and more practical structures. In amongst these sites, a visitor will see the gardeners, every one of which has a different job that is suited perfectly for them. Some might tend to the growing plants while others move soil and sand. They are also pleasant, quiet, and ready to do as they are asks. These are the hardworking citizens of the country, doing what they can to contribute to the greater good of their homeland. Kipling's speaker also makes sure to emphasize the fact that everyone has a job and is therefore occupied by the garden. There is no one who is sitting around and relaxes, everyone contributes. The last stanzas are directed at the reader or listener, telling them that they too need to make sure that they're doing everything they can for the country. It might be hard work at first, but eventually, one's hands will grow strong and their backs, painless. They too will be brought into the glory of the garden, and therefore the glory of God.","Our England is a garden that is full of stately views,
 Of borders, beds and shrubberies and lawns and avenues,
 With statues on the terraces and peacocks strutting by;
 But the Glory of the Garden lies in more than meets the eye. 

For where the old thick laurels grow, along the thin red wall,
 You’ll find the tool- and potting-sheds which are the heart of all,
 The cold-frames and the hot-houses, the dungpits and the tanks,
 The rollers, carts and drain-pipes, with the barrows and the planks. 

And there you’ll see the gardeners, the men and ’Prentice boys
 Told off to do as they are bid and do it without noise;
 For, except when seeds are planted and we shout to scare the birds,
 The Glory of the Garden it abideth not in words. 

And some can pot begonias and some can bud a rose,
 And some are hardly fit to trust with anything that grows;
 But they can roll and trim the lawns and sift the sand and loam,
 For the Glory of the Garden occupieth all who come. 

Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made
 By singing:—“Oh, how beautiful!” and sitting in the shade,
 While better men than we go out and start their working lives
 At grubbing weeds from gravel-paths with broken dinner-knives. 

There’s not a pair of legs so thin, there’s not a head so thick,
 There’s not a hand so weak and white, nor yet a heart so sick,
 But it can find some needful job that’s crying to be done,
 For the Glory of the Garden glorifieth every one. 

Then seek your job with thankfulness and work till further orders,
 If it’s only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders;
 And when your back stops aching and your hands begin to harden,
 You will find yourself a partner in the Glory of the Garden. 

Oh, Adam was a gardener, and God who made him sees
 That half a proper gardener’s work is done upon his knees,
 So when your work is finished, you can wash your hands and pray
 For the Glory of the Garden that it may not pass away!
And the Glory of the Garden it shall never pass away!",kiplingsociety.co.uk/poem/poems_glorygarden.htm
Crossroads by Ocean MisT,Ocean MisT,"‘Crossroads’ by Ocean MisT is a short, simple poem that embodies the very human argument between the head and the heart. Throughout the poem, the speaker presents the reader with a series of questions. Beneath the different images, there are two distinct possibilities for their future. Either they should ford new ground or follow a pre-made path that leads to simple happiness.","Shall I follow the stream
Or cross the sea,
Strive for a dream
Or let life be?

Shall it be neon lights
That spell sucess,
Or flickering lamplight
For happiness?

Follow the thunder?
Follow the storm?
Follow the whisper
That leaves and breeze form?

Follow my heartbeat?
Follow my head?
What shall each bring me?
Where shall each lead?",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/crossroads-29/
"You Reading This, Be Ready by William Stafford",William Stafford,"'You Reading This, Be Ready' by William Stafford describes the significance of the moment in which we live. This poem begins with a set of natural imagery. For example, Stafford refers to the creeping of sunlight on the floor, the scent of old wood, and the soft sounds that fill the air. By referring to these images, he sets the mood of the poem. Moving on to the following lines, his speaker highlights the fact that the most important gift of our lives is the air we breathe. One has to respect that gift without thinking about any worldly rewards. The moment people wait for never comes. It is up to them how they try to find exceptional satisfaction in the most ordinary of moments.","Starting here, what do you want to remember?
How sunlight creeps along a shining floor?
What scent of old wood hovers, what softened
sound from outside fills the air?

Will you ever bring a better gift for the world
than the breathing respect that you carry
wherever you go right now? Are you waiting
for time to show you some better thoughts?

When you turn around, starting here, lift this
new glimpse that you found; carry into evening
all that you want from this day. This interval you spent
reading or hearing this, keep it for life –

What can anyone give you greater than now,
starting here, right in this room, when you turn around?",mindfulnessassociation.net/words-of-wonder/you-reading-this-be-ready-william-stafford/
America For Me by Henry Van Dyke,Henry van Dyke,"'America For Me' by Henry Van Dyke is a heartfelt poem that celebrates what sets America apart from Europe. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes how they've been traveling around Europe and are thrilled to be on their way home to the United States. They live there and feel that the country has something to offer that all European countries do not. It is looking towards the future while Europe is stuck in the past. The poem ends with a repetition of some of the poem's more memorable lines.","Tis fine to see the Old World and travel up and down
Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,
To admire the crumblyh castles and the statues and kings
But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.

So it's home again, and home again, America for me!
My heart is turning home again and there I long to be,
In the land of youth and freedom, beyond the ocean bars,
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.

Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;
And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;
And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study Rome;
But when it comes to living there is no place like home.

I like the German fir-woods in green battalions drilled;
I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing foutains filled;
But, oh, to take your had, my dear, and ramble for a day
In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her sway!

I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack!
The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.
But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free-
We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.

Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!
I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling sea,
To the blessed Land of Room Enough, beyond the ocean bars,
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/america-for-me/
Everything I touch by Kobayashi Issa,Haiku Poems,"‘Everything I touch’ by Kobayashi Issa is a thoughtful haiku that speaks on love, connection, and the pain one might experience. The three short lines of this poem outline a speaker’s depressing situation. He feels as though every time he reaches out with the intention of connecting with someone, he’s rebuffed. He’s emotionally pricked, experiencing pain when he should receive love or connection in return. No matter how gentle or tender he is, the bramble always pricks him.","Everything I touch
with tenderness, alas,
pricks like a bramble",https://poemanalysis.com/kobayashi-issa/everything-i-touch/
Paul Revere’s Ride by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"Paul Revere's Ride' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is a straightforward and inspiring poem that describes the courageous ride of Paul Revere. The poem follows Paul Revere on his midnight ride. The events occur in chronological order and Longfellow gives sufficient time to develop the drama of every moment. The most dramatic and important part of the plan comes as Revere rides quickly through the countryside from village to village. He's riding with the warning that the British are coming by sea. At the end of the poem, the poet alludes to the historical importance of this moment and how, just like Revere's horse, the facts of this evening will permeate history for years to come.","Listen, my children, and you shall hear
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.

He said to his friend, “If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,—
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.”

Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war:
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.

Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers
Marching down to their boats on the shore.

Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,—
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.

Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still
That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,
The watchful night-wind, as it went
Creeping along from tent to tent,
And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”
A moment only he feels the spell
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay,—
A line of black, that bends and floats
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.

Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horse’s side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height,
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns!

A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.

He has left the village and mounted the steep,
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
And under the alders, that skirt its edge,
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.

It was twelve by the village clock
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmer’s dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises when the sun goes down.

It was one by the village clock,
When he galloped into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.

It was two by the village clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.

You know the rest. In the books you have read,
How the British Regulars fired and fled,—
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again
Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.

So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere.",https://poets.org/poem/paul-reveres-ride
Now We Are Six by A. A. Milne,Alan Alexander Milne,"Theme As is customary with A. A. Milne's work, there is an element to the poetry which is only going to be truly accessible to an adult reader. In this case, it is the theme of identity and a search for satisfaction in that identity. This plays out very clearly in lines 1-10 of 'Now We Are Six.' The young child speaking is experiencing what every member of the human race goes through as they age, a process of seeking, learning, and hopefully becoming wiser. There is a youthful ignorance contained within 'Now We Are Six' that is charming. This child is still under the impression that they will reach an age in which everything is perfect. They believe it is at “six” that they want to remain for the rest of their life. Perhaps at that moment they really believed that, but with the further shifting of time, landscapes, people, and attitudes they, along with everyone else aging, will come to realize that there is no one perfect year.","When I was one,
I had just begun.
When I was two,
I was nearly new.
When I was three,
I was hardly me.
When I was four,
I was not much more.
When I was five,
I was just alive.
But now I am six,
I'm as clever as clever.
So I think I'll be six now
for ever and ever.",https://www.scrapbook.com/poems/doc/13273.html
"[London, my beautiful] by F.S. Flint",F.S. Flint,"[London, my beautiful]' by F.S. Flint describes one speaker's love for the city of London and how he feels the city improves others and himself. The poem begins with the speaker listing out a number of things that are special about London, but are not the reasons he cares so much about “her.” He speaks of the sunsets and the “pale green sky.” Although these things are beautiful, they are not special. In the second half, the narrator comes to the moment he loves. He speaks of the moon rising over the city and lighting up the tops of the trees. When this happens he is determined to climb to the top of the trees and bask in the moonlight. His “blood” will be cooled by this action and his whole spirit lifted. ","London, my beautiful,
it is not the sunset
nor the pale green sky
shimmering through the curtain
of the silver birch,
nor the quietness;
it is not the hopping
of birds
upon the lawn,
nor the darkness
stealing over all things
that moves me.
But as the moon creeps slowly
over the tree-tops
among the stars,
I think of her
and the glow her passing
sheds on the men.
London, my beautiful,
I will climb
into the branches
to the moonlit tree-tops,
that my blood may be cooled
by the wind.",https://poets.org/poem/london-my-beautiful
Filling Station by Elizabeth Bishop,Elizabeth Bishop,"Filling Station' by Elizabeth Bishop describes a speaker's initial reaction, and later feelings, about the value of a dirty filling station. The poem begins with the speaker describing the dark, dirty, and grungy nature of a filling station. Everything seems to be covered in oil, including the father and his sons, who work there. She is at first bothered by the presence of a number of elements which tells of the family's financial situation. It is clear they live there due to the presence of a porch, chairs, and By the end of the poem, the speaker comes to the conclusion, after seeing the love given to a few parts of the home, that there is a reason to love everything and everyone. ","Oh, but it is dirty!
—this little filling station,
oil-soaked, oil-permeated
to a disturbing, over-all
black translucency.
Be careful with that match!

Father wears a dirty,
oil-soaked monkey suit
that cuts him under the arms,
and several quick and saucy
and greasy sons assist him
(it’s a family filling station),
all quite thoroughly dirty.

Do they live in the station?
It has a cement porch
behind the pumps, and on it
a set of crushed and grease-
impregnated wickerwork;
on the wicker sofa
a dirty dog, quite comfy.

Some comic books provide
the only note of color—
of certain color. They lie
upon a big dim doily
draping a taboret
(part of the set), beside
a big hirsute begonia.

Why the extraneous plant?
Why the taboret?
Why, oh why, the doily?
(Embroidered in daisy stitch
with marguerites, I think,
and heavy with gray crochet.)

Somebody embroidered the doily.
Somebody waters the plant,
or oils it, maybe. Somebody
arranges the rows of cans
so that they softly say:
esso—so—so—so
to high-strung automobiles.
Somebody loves us all.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52193/filling-station
Ode on a Grayson Perry Urn by Tim Turnbull,Tim Turnbull,"‘Ode on a Grayson Perry Urn’ by Tim Turnbull is a five stanza poem that is separated into sets of ten lines. The lines conform to a rhyming pattern of ABABCDEDCE, changing end sounds from stanza to stanza. Turnbull also chose to make use of a very traditional rhyme scheme, iambic pentameter. This means that each line is separated into five sets of two beats. The first of these is unstressed and the second stressed. This is the same form used by Keats in ‘Ode to a Grecian Urn.’ His poem follows the same rhyme scheme and is also written in iambic pentameter. Both poems, as stated in the title, are “odes.” An ode is a kind of lyric poetry that is sometimes meant to be sung. It is generally addressed to a natural subject and formatted in a specific kind of meter.","Hello! What's all this here? A kitschy vase
some Shirley Temple manqué has knocked out
delineating tales of kids in cars
on crap estates, the Burberry clad louts
who flail their motors through the smoky night
from Manchester to Motherwell or Slough,
creating bedlam on the Queen's highway.
Your gaudy evocation can, somehow,
conjure the scene without inducing fright,
as would a Daily Express exposé,
can bring to mind the throaty turbo roar
of hatchbacks tuned almost to breaking point,
the joyful throb of UK garage or
of house imported from the continent
and yet educe a sense of peace, of calm -
the screech of tyres and the nervous squeals
of girls, too young to quite appreciate
the peril they are in, are heard, but these wheels
will not lose traction, skid and flip, no harm
befall these children. They will stay out late

forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy,
on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed
the back lanes, the urban gyratory,
the wide motorways, never having need
to race back home, for work next day, to bed.
Each girl is buff, each geezer toned and strong,
charged with pulsing juice which, even yet,
fills every pair of Calvin’s and each thong,
never to be deflated, given head
in crude games of chlamydia roulette.

Now see who comes to line the sparse grass verge,
to toast them in Buckfast and Diamond White:
rat-boys and corn-rowed cheerleaders who urge
them on to pull more burn-outs or to write
their donut Os, as signature, upon
the bleached tarmac of dead suburban streets.
There dogs set up a row and curtains twitch
as pensioners and parents telephone
the cops to plead for quiet, sue for peace -
tranquility, though, is for the rich.
And so, millennia hence, you garish crock,
when all context is lost, galleries razed
to level dust and we're long in the box,
will future poets look on you amazed,
speculate how children might have lived when
you were fired, lives so free and bountiful
and there, beneath a sun a little colder,
declare How happy were those creatures then,
who knew the truth was all negotiable
and beauty in the gift of the beholder.",https://genius.com/Tim-turnbull-ode-on-a-grayson-perry-urn-annotated
Tucson by Stephen Dunn,Stephen Dunn,"'Tucson' by Stephen Dunn is an interesting narrative poem that depicts a bar fight between two men, one of whom was violating social norms. The poem begins with a description of all the “wrong” things that one man did. He chose the wrong woman, the wrong bar, and the wrong part of town. These were all conscious choices on his part. He knew that by going where he went with whom he went with that, he'd be asking for a fight. That's exactly what happened. The poem ends with one of the men in the bar suggesting that people come to the bar because it's a “good fighting bar,” but you won't get hurt unless you need to.","A man was dancing with the wrong woman
in the wrong bar, the wrong part of town.
He must have chosen the woman, the place,
as keenly as you choose what to wear
when you dress to kill.
And the woman, who could have said no,
must have made her choice years ago,
to look like the kind of trouble
certain men choose as their own.
I was there for no good reason myself,
with a friend looking for a friend,
but I’m not important.
They were dancing close
when a man from the bar decided
the dancing was wrong. I’d forgotten
how fragile the face is, how fists too
are just so many small bones.
The bouncer waited, then broke in.
Someone wiped up the blood.
The woman began to dance
with another woman, each in tight jeans.
The air pulsed. My hands
were fidgety, damp.
We were Mexicans, Indians, whites.
The woman was part this, part that.
My friend said nothing’s wrong, stay put,
it’s a good fighting bar, you won’t get hurt
unless you need to get hurt.",https://thefoodpoet.com/poetry-curated-tucson-by-stephen-dunn/
"Pad, Pad by Stevie Smith",Stevie Smith,"'Pad, Pad' by Stevie Smith describes a speaker's present mental state after being dejected in love long years back. In the first stanza of this poem, readers come across an image of a lady dressed in a kimono and flowers. She is sitting in a crouch like a tiger waiting for its prey. Unfortunately, the prey is none other than the speaker himself. The lady told him that she had no feelings left in her heart. It was better to leave. The years fled by. In the present, when he thinks of his past, he does not feel like before. One's youthful years spurs passionate emotions in the heart. But when the person matures, he takes decisions carefully.","I always remember your beautiful flowers
And the beautiful kimono you wore
When you sat on the couch
With that tigerish crouch
And told me you loved me no more.

What I cannot remember is how I felt when you were unkind
All I know is, if you were unkind now I should not mind.
Ah me, the power to feel exaggerated, angry and sad
The years have taken from me. Softly I go now, pad pad.","https://allpoetry.com/Pad,-Pad"
Sonnet 54 by Edmund Spenser,Edmund Spenser,"Sonnet 54 is part of Spenser’s Amoretti, an eighty-nine sonnet cycle. Amoretti was published in 1595, and it depicts Spenser’s courtship and eventual marriage to Elizabeth Boyle. In Sonnet 54, Spenser uses the theatre to describe his situation as a lover; the lyrical voice is the actor who plays various roles and his loved one is the unmoved spectator. Thus, Sonnet 54 is a conceit that relates the lyrical voice’s actions to that of the theatre.

Sonnet 54 is a Spenserian sonnet, formed by three interlocked quatrains and a couplet. The rhyme scheme is ABAB BCBC CDCD EE and it has iambic pentameter. The main theme in Sonnet 54 is unreciprocated love and the tone of the poem shows the lyrical voice’s frustration passing through annoyance and anger.","Of this worlds Theatre in which we stay,
My love lyke the Spectator ydly sits
Beholding me that all the pageants play,
Disguysing diversly my troubled wits.
Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits,
And mask in myrth lyke to a Comedy:
Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits,
I waile and make my woes a Tragedy.
Yet she beholding me with constant eye,
Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart:
But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cry

Going Wrong by Jack Gilbert,Jack Gilbert,"Going Wrong' by Jack Gilbert begins by focusing on the journey of fish upstream, where a man living off the wild catches and eats them. This man is going insane, having retreated from society to live by himself. Instead of doing this out of being 'stubborn', he believes it is due to 'greed', wanting to live his life among nature. The poem could be understood as a debate between the rejection and acceptance of nature, the man ignoring humanity in order to be closer to nature.","The fish are dreadful. They are brought up
the mountain in the dawn most days, beautiful
and alien and cold from night under the sea,
the grand rooms fading from their flat eyes.
Soft machinery of the dark, the man thinks,
washing them. ""What can you know of my machinery!""
demands the Lord. Sure, the man says quietly
and cuts into them, laying back the dozen struts,
getting to the muck of something terrible.
The Lord insists: ""You are the one who chooses
to live this way. I build cities where things
are human. I make Tuscany and you go to live
with rock and silence."" The man washes away
the blood and arranges the fish on a big plate.
Starts the onions in the hot olive oil and puts
in peppers. ""You have lived all year without women.""
He takes out everything and puts in the fish.
""No one knows where you are. People forget you.
You are vain and stubborn."" The man slices
tomatoes and lemons. Takes out the fish
and scrambles eggs. I am not stubborn, he thinks,
laying all of it on the table in the courtyard
full of early sun, shadows of swallows flying
on the food. Not stubborn, just greedy.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/154251/going-wrong
Looking for Judas by Adrian C. Louis,Adrian C. Louis,"Adrian C. Louis' poem 'Looking for Judas' centers on a speaker who talks about how “they” (white men) acted like Judas in order to colonize the Native American people. This poem begins with the imagery of blood. The speaker describes how he hanged the “five-point mule deer” in an old barn. Its blood resembled that of Christ. The same innocence can be seen in their eyes. It reminds the speaker of the history of Native Americans. Being an indigenous representative, he describes how the white men used religion to unite and colonize the natives without spilling more blood.","Weathered gray, the wooden walls
of the old barn soak in the bright
sparkling blood of the five-point mule
deer I hang there in the moonlight.
Gutted, skinned, and shimmering in eternal
nakedness, the glint in its eyes could
be stolen from the dry hills of Jerusalem.
They say before the white man
brought us Jesus, we had honor.
They say when we killed the Deer People,
we told them their spirits
would live in our flesh.
We used bows of ash, no spotlights, no rifles,
and their holy blood became ours.
Or something like that.",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/looking-judas
Try to Praise the Mutilated World by Adam Zagajewski,Adam Zagajewski,"The poem begins with 'try', suggesting that 'to praise the mutilated world' is something that must be worked at. Yet, this balance changes throughout the poem, ending with the imperative command 'Praise the mutilated world.” After giving an example after example of moments where things aren't perfect and can go wrong, Zagajewski asks the reader to be happy for what they have, and find positivity in those harder moments.","Try to praise the mutilated world.
Remember June's long days,
and wild strawberries, drops of rosé wine.
The nettles that methodically overgrow
the abandoned homesteads of exiles.
You must praise the mutilated world.
You watched the stylish yachts and ships;
one of them had a long trip ahead of it,
while salty oblivion awaited others.
You've seen the refugees going nowhere,
you've heard the executioners sing joyfully.
You should praise the mutilated world.
Remember the moments when we were together
in a white room and the curtain fluttered.
Return in thought to the concert where music flared.
You gathered acorns in the park in autumn
and leaves eddied over the earth's scars.
Praise the mutilated world
and the gray feather a thrush lost,
and the gentle light that strays and vanishes
and returns.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57095/try-to-praise-the-mutilated-world-56d23a3f28187
To a Poor Old Woman by William Carlos Williams,William Carlos Williams,"'To a Poor Old Woman' by William Carlos Williams is a short and powerful poem about an old woman's pleasure when eating plums. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by describing an old woman eating plums. She has a bag of them and is eating them one at a time, enjoying every moment of the experience. She's poor, meaning that she is likely more accustomed to encountering troubles in her everyday life than another person of greater economic means. This makes the experience all the more powerful. She's completely engaged with the moment and enjoying the taste of the ripe fruit.","munching a plum on the street a paper bag
of them in her hand
They taste good to her
They taste good to her. They taste
good to her
You can see it by
the way she gives herself
to the one half
sucked out in her hand
Comforted
a solace of ripe plums
seeming to fill the air
They taste good to her",poetryfoundation.org/poems/51653/to-a-poor-old-woman
Welsh History by R.S. Thomas,Ronald Stuart Thomas,"Welsh History is a metaphor rich piece about the history of the Welsh people. Thomas creates a narrative for the reader that directly engages them with the troubled history of Wales, how its people fought endless battles and lived on very little. The Welsh lost and regained their history through legends, and even when they were thought of as undeserving of life, maintained their strength to fight against those that would take their homes from them. The poem ends on a hopeful note in which the Welsh no longer have to beg under the table for scraps or “[gnaw] the bones / Of a dead culture.” They will arise from their destitute state and create a modern culture fuelled by their past.","We were a people taut for war; the hills
Were no harder, the thin grass
Clothed them more warmly than the coarse
Shirts our small bones.
We fought, and were always in retreat,
Like snow thawing upon the slopes
Of Mynydd Mawr; and yet the stranger
Never found our ultimate stand
In the thick woods, declaiming verse
To the sharp prompting of the harp.
Our kings died, or they were slain
By the old treachery at the ford.
Our bards perished, driven from the halls
Of nobles by the thorn and bramble.
We were a people bred on legends,
Warming our hands at the red past.
The great were ashamed of our loose rags
Clinging stubbornly to the proud tree
Of blood and birth, our lean bellies
And mud houses were a proof
Of our ineptitude for life.
We were a people wasting ourselves
In fruitless battles for our masters,
In lands to which we had no claim,
With men for whom we felt no hatred.
We were a people, and are so yet.
When we have finished quarrelling for crumbs
Under the table, or gnawing the bones
Of a dead culture, we will arise
And greet each other in a new dawn.",https://allpoetry.com/Welsh-History
Milkweed by Helen Hunt Jackson,Helen Hunt Jackson,"'Milkweed' by Helen Hunt Jackson is a beautiful poem that talks about the milkweed flowers and why the poet prefers this flower the most. In this poem, the poet evokes the spirit of the milkweed and asks it a few questions. The poetic persona of this poem wants to emphasize its simplicity and serene beauty by using such questions. According to her, there seems a mystery in its origin. The milk that runs through its veins has divine importance in her eyes. With the glorification of the plant the first section ends. Thereafter, in the next section, the poet depicts some butterflies that throng near the flowers of the milkweed plant. They seem to her like jewels sparkling in the sunlight.","O patient creature with a peasant face, 
Burnt by the summer sun, begrimed with stains, 
And standing humbly in the dingy lanes! 
There seems a mystery in thy work and place, 
Which crowns thee with significance and grace; 
Whose is the milk that fills thy faithful veins? 
What royal nursling comes at night and drains 
Unscorned the food of the plebeian race? 
By day I mark no living thing which rests 
On thee, save butterflies of gold and brown, 
Who turn from flowers that are more fair, more sweet, 
And, crowding eagerly, sink fluttering down, 
And hang, like jewels flashing in the heat, 
Upon thy splendid rounded purple breasts.",https://poets.org/poem/milkweed
To a Skylark by Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"'To a Skylark' by Percy Bysshe Shelley is an ode to the “blithe” essence of a singing skylark and how human beings are unable to ever reach that same bliss. The poem begins with the speaker spotting a skylark flying above him. He can hear the song clearly. The bird's song “unpremeditated” is unplanned and beautiful. Shelley is stunned by the music produced by the bird and entranced by its movement as it flies into the clouds and out of sight. Although he can no longer see it, he is still able to hear it and feel its presence. The bird represents the pure, unbridled happiness that Shelley is desperately seeking. This desperation comes through in the next stanzas. The poet then embarks on a number of metaphors through which he is hoping to better understand what the bird is and what he can accurately compare it to. He sees the bird as a “high-born maiden” that serenades her lover below her and spring, or “vernal,” showers that rain on the flowers below. The skylark is like “rainbow clouds” and the epitome of all “Joyous” things. The next section of the ode is used to ask the skylark to reveal what inspires it to sing such a glorious song. Is it, the poet asks, “fields, or waves, or mountains?” Could it be, he speculates, “shapes of sky or plain?” Whatever it may be, Shelley has never seen anything that could force such sounds from his own voice. He states that for a creature to have the ability to sing in such a way, it must know nothing of sorrow or “annoyance.” The bird must have the ability to see beyond life, understand death, and feel no concern about it. This is why humans may never reach the same state of happiness that the skylark exists within. “We” pine for things that we do not have, and even our “sweetest songs” are full of the “saddest thought[s].” 'To a Skylark' concludes with the poet pleading with the bird to “Teach [him] half the gladness / That thy brain must know.” Even that small amount would provide Shelley with the ability to produce “harmonious madness” that would force the world to listen to him must as raptly as he is listening to the skylark now.","Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
Bird thou never wert,
That from Heaven, or near it,
Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
Higher still and higher
From the earth thou springest
Like a cloud of fire;
The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightning
Of the sunken sun,
O'er which clouds are bright'ning,
Thou dost float and run;
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
The pale purple even
Melts around thy flight;
Like a star of Heaven,
In the broad day-light
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight,
Keen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere,
Whose intense lamp narrows
In the white dawn clear
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
All the earth and air
With thy voice is loud,
As, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflow'd.
What thou art we know not;
What is most like thee?
From rainbow clouds there flow not
Drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
Like a Poet hidden
In the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden,
Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
Like a high-born maiden
In a palace-tower,
Soothing her love-laden
Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:
Like a glow-worm golden
In a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden
Its aëreal hue
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
Like a rose embower'd
In its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflower'd,
Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves:
Sound of vernal showers
On the twinkling grass,
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All that ever was
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.
Teach us, Sprite or Bird,
What sweet thoughts are thine:
I have never heard
Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus Hymeneal,
Or triumphal chant,
Match'd with thine would be all
But an empty vaunt,
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
What objects are the fountains
Of thy happy strain?
What fields, or waves, or mountains?
What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
With thy clear keen joyance
Languor cannot be:
Shadow of annoyance
Never came near thee:
Thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep
Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after,
And pine for what is not:
Our sincerest laughter
With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet if we could scorn
Hate, and pride, and fear;
If we were things born
Not to shed a tear,
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures
Of delightful sound,
Better than all treasures
That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness
That thy brain must know,
Such harmonious madness
From my lips would flow
The world should listen then, as I am listening now.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45146/to-a-skylark
What Happened to the Elephant? by Sujata Bhatt,Sujata Bhatt,"'What Happened to the Elephant?' by Sujata Bhatt is about a child's curiosity and stories of religion. In the first part of this poem, the speaker begins by conveying the curious questions of a child who is trying to understand the Hindu story of how Ganesh lost his head and gained the head of an elephant. The child wonders what happened to the elephant who gave a head and if it was possible to give the elephant a new head as well, perhaps a horse's head. Unintentionally inspired by the child's probings, the adult narrator takes the story further in imagines the sorrow that the elephant's family would experience upon seeing their fellow heard member decapitated and killed.","What happend to the elephant
the one whose head Shiva stole
to bring his son Ganesh
back to life?
This is child’s curiosity,
The rosy imagination
that continues
probing, looking for a way
to believe the fantasy
a way to prolong the story.
If Ganesh could still be Ganesh
With an elephant’s head,
Then couldn’t the body of that elephant
find another life
with a horse’s head-for example?
And if we found
a horse’s head to revive
the elephant’s body-
who is the true elephant?
And what shall we do about the horse’s body?
Still the child refuses
to accept Shiva’s carelessness
and searches for a solution
without death.
But now when I gaze
at the framed postcard
of Ganesh on my wall,
I also picture a rotting carcass
of a beheaded elephant
lying crumpled up
on its side, covered with bird shit,
vulture shit-
Oh, that elephant
whose head survived
for Ganesh,
he dies, of course, but the others
in his heard, the hundreds
in his family must have found him.
They stared at him for hours
with their slow swaying sadness…
How they turned and turned
in a circle, with their trunks
facing outwards and then inwards
toward the headless one.
This is a dance,
a group dance
no one talks about.",https://sanslittleblcony.tumblr.com/post/137616447269/what-happened-to-the-elephant-sujata-bhatt
Song For a Dark Girl by Langston Hughes,Langston Hughes,"Song For a Dark Girl' by Langston Hughes is a darkly depressing poem that depicts the death of a young black man and his lover's heartbreak. The poem describes through simple stanzas the loss that this young woman has suffered. Her young black lover has been lynched and strung up in a crossroads tree, an image that alludes to the death of Christ on the cross. Her heart is broken and her world transformed. God doesn't comfort her and she feels as though her prayers are useless. Now, all love is represented by that shadowed, naked body.","Way Down South in Dixie
(Break the heart of me)
They hung my black young lover
To a cross roads tree.

Way Down South in Dixie

What was the use of prayer.

On a gnarled and naked tree.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326873-Song-For-A-Dark-Girl-by-Langston-Hughes
Grandfather by Michael S. Harper,Michael S. Harper,"'Grandfather' by Michael S. Harper is a powerful poem about the poet's grandfather and racism within the United States. The poem draws on details from the early 1900s, including the famously controversial film, The Birth of a Nation, in order to describe what Harper's grandfather endured. The poem opens with a description of his white neighbors coming to burn down his house, believing it was their right to drive him out of their neighborhood. The poem progresses into more personal territory, alluding to the close relationship between the poet as a boy and his aging grandfather.","In 1915 my grandfather’s
neighbors surrounded his house
near the dayline he ran
on the Hudson
in Catskill, NY
and thought they’d burn
his family out
in a movie they’d just seen
and be rid of his kind:
the death of a lone black
family is the Birth
of a Nation,
or so they thought.
His 5’4” waiter gait
quenched the white jacket smile
he’d brought back from watered
polish of my father
on the turning seats,
and he asked his neighbors
up on his thatched porch
for the first blossom of fire
that would bring him down.
They went away, his nation,
spittooning their torched necks
in the shadows of the riverboat
they’d seen, posse decomposing;
and I see him on Sutter
with white bag from your
restaurant, challenged by his first
grandson to a foot-race
he will win in white clothes.

I see him as he buys galoshes
for his railed yard near Mineo’s
metal shop, where roses jump
as the el circles his house
toward Brooklyn, where his rain fell;
and I see cigar smoke in his eyes,
chocolate Madison Square Garden chews
he breaks on his set teeth,
stitched up after cancer,
the great white nation immovable
as his weight wilts
and he is on a porch
that won’t hold my arms,
or the legs of the race run
forwards, or the film
played backwards on his grandson’s eyes.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42828/grandfather-56d221776a6c6
Born Yesterday by Philip Larkin,Philip Larkin,"One literary analyst describes Larkin’s works: ‘Born Yesterday’. She says, “the topic of happiness—what it is, how to attain and cultivate it—is crucial to his work”. This topic is particularly obvious in ‘Born Yesterday. Larkin seems to hint that he has found a source of true happiness, and that it has nothing to do with beauty, talent, or fame. Therefore, he wishes this young girl to be plain and average, that she might achieve happiness in life.

The fact that Larkin seems to be so obsessed with the theme of happiness, could mean one of two things. Either he has found a source of true happiness, or he has simply found what is not the true source of happiness. Either way, this poem speaks volumes about life and meaning and purpose. While most people seem to think that beauty, money, fame, or intelligence is what makes a person worthwhile, Larkin points out the fallacy of this belief. He does this in a simple, yet profound way. He dedicates this poem to Sally Amis. This is the daughter of Larkin’s lifelong friend. Sally is clearly a child Larkin cares for dearly. Yet, he does not wish her to have all that the world has to offer. Rather, he wishes for her to have a simple happiness, and he believes that she will find that happiness more readily if she is plain in looks and average in intelligence (Wetzsteon).","For Sally Amis

Tightly-folded bud,
I have wished you something
None of the others would:
Not the usual stuff
About being beautiful,
Or running off a spring
Of innocence and love —
They will all wish you that,
And should it prove possible,
Well, you’re a lucky girl.

But if it shouldn’t, then
May you be ordinary;
Have, like other women,
An average of talents:
Not ugly, not good-looking,
Nothing uncustomary
To pull you off your balance,
That, unworkable itself,
Stops all the rest from working.
In fact, may you be dull —
If that is what a skilled,
Vigilant, flexible,
Unemphasised, enthralled
Catching of happiness is called",https://readalittlepoetry.com/2012/03/19/born-yesterday-by-philip-larkin/
Distant Shore by Valerie Dohren,Valerie Dohren,"Distant Shore' by Valerie Dohren is a love poem that touches on the possibility of reincarnations and a love that is not defined by the boundaries of time. The speaker addresses her lover throughout 'Distant Shore,' telling them that they need not fear death as for the two of them it is not the end. Their love, she likes to think, is more powerful than time. Over and over, life after life, she knows that they have loved one another and will continue to do so.","O could it be that we have known
Such tender love before -
That we have loved each other so
Upon some distant shore.

Within the far and long lost past
Then maybe you were mine -
I held you in my gentle grasp,
Set in another time.

And could it be the Moon above
Has watched our warm embrace,
And seen us kiss so sweetly in
Some other far off place.

Beyond the boundaries of time,
Perchance our love did grow -
For now I love you, as I deem
I loved you long ago.

And thus when darkness steals our souls
I know our love won’t die,
For it will blossom in the dawn
That lights another sky.

Don’t weep my love, my sweetest love,
Forever we shall be
Two hearts united through all time,
Into eternity.",poemhunter.com/poem/distant-shore-4/
To Speak of Woe That Is In Marriage by Robert Lowell,Robert Lowell,"'To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage' by Robert Lowell is a confessional poem told from the perspective of a woman trapped in a dangerous marriage. In the first line of the poem, the speaker begins on a positive note, describing spring and life beginning. This may be interpreted as the speaker being pregnant. She goes on, informing the reader that her life is far from ideal. Her husband goes out, drunk or on drugs, every night and has sex with prostitutes. When he comes home, she has to fear for her life and do what she can to protect herself. In an effort to stay safe from her husband and try to keep her husband off the streets, she begins tying his car keys and a $10 bill to her thigh at night. Structure and Form 'To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage' by Robert Lowell is a fourteen-line poem that is contained within a single stanza of text. The poem is written in the form of a fourteen-line sonnet with a rhyme scheme of AABBCCDDEEFFGG. This does not conform to any of the most popular, traditional rhyme schemes poets use in sonnet writing. But, it does have elements of both a Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnet. For example, there is a clear transition between the eighth and ninth lines, similar to those seen in Petrarchan sonnets, and the poet uses couplets as both Shakespeare and Petrarch do in their sonnets.","The hot night makes us keep our bedroom windows open.
Our magnolia blossoms. Life begins to happen.
My hopped up husband drops his home disputes,
and hits the streets to cruise for prostitutes,
free-lancing out along the razor’s edge.
This screwball might kill his wife, then take the pledge.
Oh the monotonous meanness of his lust. . .
It’s the injustice . . . he is so unjust—
whiskey-blind, swaggering home at five.
My only thought is how to keep alive.
What makes him tick? Each night now I tie
ten dollars and his car key to my thigh. . . .
Gored by the climacteric of his want,
he stalls above me like an elephant.",https://poets.org/poem/speak-woe-marriage

A Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever (from Endymion) by John Keats,John Keats,"The first book of “Endymion” by John Keats details the speaker's beliefs regarding the power of beauty and his intentions to tell the story of Endymion. The poem begins with the speaker describing, at length, the power he believes beauty holds over human life. He sees it as a guiding force that, when accepted and appreciated, enters into one's heart and helps to clear one's path through life. Once one fully knows beauty, it will never leave. It transforms the onlooker into a beautiful object. The second half of the poem describes the speaker's plan to tell the long story of Endymion, a character from Greek mythology. He announces his intentions, primes the audience for a long story, and sends out a “herald” to tell the world what is about to happen.","BOOK I
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
Nor do we merely feel these essences
For one short hour; no, even as the trees
That whisper round a temple become soon
Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
The passion poesy, glories infinite,
Haunt us till they become a cheering light
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast;
They always must be with us, or we die.
Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
Will trace the story of Endymion.
The very music of the name has gone
Into my being, and each pleasant scene
Is growing fresh before me as the green
Of our own valleys: so I will begin
Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
Now while the early budders are just new,
And run in mazes of the youngest hue
About old forests; while the willow trails
Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
My little boat, for many quiet hours,
With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
Many and many a verse I hope to write,
Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
I must be near the middle of my story.
O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
See it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold,
With universal tinge of sober gold,
Be all about me when I make an end.
And now, at once adventuresome, I send
My herald thought into a wilderness:
There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44469/endymion-56d2239287ca5
Sonnet by James Weldon Johnson,James Weldon Johnson,"Sonnet' by James Weldon Johnson is a simple, motivational poem that sees a speaker encourages his own heart to strive for bravery rather than fear. In the poem, Johnson addresses the unavoidable darkness and drear in the world. It's something that his speaker's heart as shied away from in the past. He asks his heart to confront it and remember that it's always darkest right before the morning comes. In the end, he concludes that the scariest and most terrible parts of the world may be pushed back by one who strives to do what's right.","My heart be brave, and do not falter so, Nor utter more that deep, despairing wail. Thy way is very dark and drear I know, But do not let thy strength and courage fail; For certain as the raven-winged night
Is followed by the bright and blushing morn, Thy coming morrow will be clear and bright; ’Tis darkest when the night is furthest worn. Look up, and out, beyond, surrounding clouds, And do not in thine own gross darkness grope, Rise up, and casting off thy hind’ring shrouds, Cling thou to this, and ever inspiring hope:
Tho’ thick the battle and tho’ fierce the fight,
There is a power making for the right.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49052/sonnet-56d22aca442e3
Of Many Worlds in This World by Margaret Cavendish,Margaret Cavendish,"'Of Many Worlds in This World' by Margaret Cavendish describes the state of the world and how it contains an infinite number of smaller worlds. The speaker begins Of Many Worlds in This World by stating that the world is like a “nest of boxes.” It is made out of different-sized boxes, all placed within one another. This nesting of the world is a perfect metaphor for how the existence known to humankind lies on and within the existences of other organisms. These other worlds might be, the speaker describes, smaller than a human could ever see. They might be “Thinner and less” than anything yet known. This does not mean that they don't exist. It also doesn't mean they are not valuable or worth understanding. In the next set of lines, the speaker makes a comparison between the size of an imagined world and a “ladies ear-ring.” The “world” could be small enough to fit within or on a piece of jewelry. The speaker seems to marvel at this concept. She sees beauty in the fact that a world of “creatures,” as she describes them, could fit on a pendant, or on each of a ladies earrings.

Degrees of sizes in each box are found:
So, in this world, may many others be
Thinner and less, and less still by degree:
Although they are not subject to our sense,
A world may be no bigger than two-pence.
Nature is curious, and such works may shape,
Which our dull senses easily escape:
For creatures, small as atoms, may there be,
If every one a creature’s figure bear.
If atoms four, a world can make, then see
What several worlds might in an ear-ring be:
For, millions of those atoms may be in
The head of one small, little, single pin.
And if thus small, then ladies may well wear
A world of worlds, as pendents in each ear.",https://poets.org/poem/many-worlds-world
Anniversary by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"'Anniversary' by Ted Hughes commemorates the poet's dead mother and her sister, Miriam, on her death anniversary. 'Anniversary' by Ted Hughes is a commemorative poem that glorifies the spirit of the poet's mother. Her soul has an angelic outlook in the poet's imagination. The poet revisits the thoughts of his mother after seeing the torn diary page marked 13 May. On it, his brother had written, “Ma died today”. But, for the poet, she is still alive, in his poetic imagination, brimming with heavenly light. There is an out-worldly feature in her voice and her complexion. Hughes can hear what his mother tells his sister who is also dead. Their conversation forms the basis of the poem and in the end, the poet imaginatively goes nearer to the weeping spirit of his mother. Sadly, she doesn't weep for him. As a jealous sibling, the poet thinks she cries only for his brother. And, she loves the poet through the thoughts of his brother.","My mother in her feathers of flame
Grows taller. Every May Thirteenth
I see her with her sister Miriam. I lift
The torn-off diary page where my brother jotted
“Ma died today” – and there they are.


She is now as tall as Miriam.
In the perpetual Sunday Morning
Of everlasting, they are strolling together
Listening to the larks
Ringing in their orbits. The work of the cosmos,
Creation and destruction of matter
And of anti-matter
Pulses and flares, shudders and fades
Like the Northern Lights in their feathers.

My mother is telling Miriam
About her life, which was mine. Her voice comes, piping,
Down a deep gorge of woodland echoes:
“This is the water-line, dark on my dress, look,
Where I dragged him from the reservoir.
And that is the horse on which I galloped
Through the brick wall
And out over the heather simply
To bring him a new pen. This is the pen
I laid on the altar. And these
Are the mass marriages of him and his brother
Where I was not once a guest.” Then suddenly
She is scattering the red coals with her fingers
To find where I had fallen
For the third time. She laughs
Helplessly till she weeps. Miriam
Who died at eighteen
Is Madonna-like with pure wonder
To hear of all she missed. Now my mother
Shows her the rosary prayers of unending worry,
Like pairs of shoes, or one dress after another
“This is the sort of thing”, she is saying,
“I liked to wear best.” And: “Much of it,
You know, was simply sitting at the window
Watching the horizon. Truly
Wonderful it was, day after day,
Knowing they were somewhere. It still is.
Look.”

And they pause, on the brink
Of the starry dew. They are looking at me.
My mother, darker with her life,
Her Red Indian hair, her skin
So strangely olive and other-worldly,
Miriam now sheer flame beside her.
Their feathers throb softly, iridescent.
My mother’s face is glistening
As if she held it into the skyline wind
Looking towards me. I do this for her.

She is using me to tune finer
Her weeping love for my brother, through mine,
As if I were the shadow cast by this approach.

As when I came a mile over fields and walls
Towards her, and found her weeping for him –
Able for all that distance to think me him.",https://arlindo-correia.com/220201.html
S.I.W. by Wilfred Owen,Wilfred Owen,"S.I.W. stands for self-inflicted wound. Soldiers who had grown too traumatized by war, or in general wanted to be back home with their loved ones, took to hoping for what were known as 'blighty wounds' – injuries that would send them back home to England without a hope of convalescing. The more desperate of the soldiers took to shooting off their own fingers, in the hopes that they would be sent home and never called up to active duty again; however, the British Army soon caught wind of this scheme, and soldiers who were thought to have SIWs were treated like garbage. Overall, approximately 4000 soldiers were found guilty of SIWs and sentenced to long prison stays. Discover more Wilfred Owen poems.","I will to the King,
And offer him consolation in his trouble,
For that man there has set his teeth to die,
And being one that hates obedience,
Discipline, and orderliness of life,
I cannot mourn him.
W.B. YEATS
I. THE PROLOGUE
Patting good-bye, doubtless they told the lad
He’d always show the Hun a brave man’s face;
Father would sooner him dead than in disgrace,—
Was proud to see him going, aye, and glad.
Perhaps his mother whimpered how she’d fret
Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse.
Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse …
Brothers—would send his favourite cigarette.
Each week, month after month, they wrote the same,
Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut,
Because he said so, writing on his butt
Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim
And misses teased the hunger of his brain.
His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand
Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand
From the best sand-bags after years of rain.
But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,
Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld
For torture of lying machinally shelled,
At the pleasure of this world’s Powers who’d run amok.
He’d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol.
Their people never knew. Yet they were vile.
‘Death sooner than dishonour, that’s the style!’
So Father said.
II. THE ACTION
One dawn, our wire patrol
Carried him. This time, Death had not missed.
We could do nothing but wipe his bleeding cough.
Could it be accident? - Rifles go off…
Not sniped? No. (Later they found the English ball.)
III. THE POEM
It was the reasoned crisis of his soul
Against more days of inescapable thrall,
Against infrangibly wired and blind trench wall
Curtained with fire, roofed in with creeping fire,
Slow grazing fire, that would not burn him whole
But kept him for death’s promises and scoff,
And life’s half-promising, and both their riling.
IV. THE EPILOGUE
With him they buried the muzzle his teeth had kissed,
And truthfully wrote the Mother, ‘Tim died smiling’.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57346/s-i-w
Her Husband by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"'Her Husband' is quite original because the title can be considered as the first line of the poem, especially considering Hughes's excessive use of Caesura throughout the poem. Every line in the first stanza practices Caesura which makes it safe for us to conclude that the title is indeed the first line (as there is no punctuation after the title as well). You can be read in full here and more poetry from Ted Hughes here.","Comes home dull with coal-dust deliberately
To grime the sink and foul towels and let her
Learn with scrubbing brush and scrubbing board
The stubborn character of money.

And let her learn through what kind of dust
He has earned his thirst and the right to quench it
And what sweat he has exchanged for his money
And the blood-weight of money. He’ll humble her

With new light on her obligations.
The fried, woody, chips, kept warm two hours in the oven,
Are only part of her answer.
Hearing the rest, he slams them to the fire back

And is away round the house-end singing
‘Come back to Sorrento’ in a voice
Of resounding corrugated iron.
Her back has bunched into a hump as an insult.

For they will have their rights.
Their jurors are to be assembled
From the little crumbs of soot. Their brief
Goes straight up to heaven and nothing more is heard of it.",https://martyncrucefix.com/2016/04/26/they-will-have-their-rights-ted-hughes-her-husband/
"Morningside Heights, July by William Matthews",William Matthews,"'Morningside Heights, July' by William Matthews explores life within a city. Matthews begins with the weather, looking at the 'Haze' of the location. He moves through a group of 'student violinists', the sound of 'jackhammers', the quality of 'Granular light' that he sees. Each of the images in the poem follows a different sense, Matthews providing an in-depth depiction of the city. Stories begin to emerge from these images, a woman who 'call[s] it off' with 'a man', two cab drivers arguing in Farsi. The final few images focus on blending city and nature, the 'chill air', and 'Hail' sandwiching the city sound of 'A car alarm'. The poem provides a summer view of a city, everything inside following each other in an eternal hum.","Haze. Three student violists boarding
a bus. A clatter of jackhammers.
Granular light. A film of sweat for primer
and the heat for a coat of paint.
A man and a woman on a bench:
she tells him he must be psychic,
for how else could he sense, even before she knew,
that she’d need to call it off? A bicyclist
fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped
hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle
on the boil. I never meant, she says.
But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost
collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi.
I’m sorry, she says. The comforts
of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon.
The sky blurs—there’s a storm coming
up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly
around a corner. How familiar
it feels to feel strange, hollower
than a bassoon. A rill of chill air
in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/42929/morningside-heights-july
The Grave of Keats by Oscar Wilde,Oscar Wilde,"'The Grave of Keats' by Oscar Wilde describes the physical state of the dead poet's grave and the emotional impact that his short life had on England. The poem begins with the speaker hoping to cheer up his own, and the reader's mood, by speaking of the new world, alongside God, that Keats is now residing in. He is beyond the problems and discomforts of the world. His death was incredibly important to the speaker, he holds a saint-like stature in the speaker's mind. He continues on to say that, while viewing the spot in which Keats is buried, there are no huge trees to block out the sun, only violets that wrap around “his bones,” or more likely, tombstone. Keats is compared to Saint Sebastian, an early Christian who was martyred for his faith. Keats is often thought of as having contracted tuberculosis due to grief. In the final sestet of the poem, the speaker describes Keats as being the finest English “poet-painter” since the Greek poets of old. He made a monumental impact on the speaker's life and on his readers. He concludes by quoting the inscription on the tombstone and saying that he will do whatever it takes to keep that land green, even if he has to water it with his own tears.","Rid of the world’s injustice, and his pain,
He rests at last beneath God’s veil of blue:
Taken from life when life and love were new
The youngest of the martyrs here is lain,
Fair as Sebastian, and as early slain.
No cypress shades his grave, no funeral yew,
But gentle violets weeping with the dew
Weave on his bones an ever-blossoming chain.
O proudest heart that broke for misery!
O sweetest lips since those of Mitylene!
O poet-painter of our English Land!
Thy name was writ in water—it shall stand:
And tears like mine will keep thy memory green,
As Isabella did her Basil-tree.",https://poets.org/poem/grave-keats
The Patriot by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,"'The Patriot' by Robert Browning is a tragic, dramatic monologue about a man who dedicated his entire life to supporting his country. The poem is heavy with irony as it describes a man who had given everything up for his people and was initially revered by them, only to be killed at their hands without a second thought in the end.","AN OLD STORY.

I.

It was roses, roses, all the way,
With myrtle mixed in my path like mad:
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,
The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,
A year ago on this very day.

II.

The air broke into a mist with bells,
The old walls rocked with the crowd and cries.
Had I said, ``Good folk, mere noise repels---
But give me your sun from yonder skies!''
They had answered, ``And afterward, what else?''

III.

Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun
To give it my loving friends to keep!
Nought man could do, have I left undone:
And you see my harvest, what I reap
This very day, now a year is run.

IV.

There's nobody on the house-tops now---
Just a palsied few at the windows set;
For the best of the sight is, all allow,
At the Shambles' Gate---or, better yet,
By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.

V.

I go in the rain, and, more than needs,
A rope cuts both my wrists behind;
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,
For they fling, whoever has a mind,
Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.

VI.

Thus I entered, and thus I go!
In triumphs, people have dropped down dead.
``Paid by the world, what dost thou owe
``Me?''---God might question; now instead,
'Tis God shall repay: I am safer so.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-patriot/
Sunny Prestatyn by Philip Larkin,Philip Larkin,"‘Sunny Prestatyn’ by Philip Larkin describes the destruction of a poster advertising an unattainable, seemingly perfect lifestyle. The poem begins with the speaker describing a poster advertising “Prestatyn,” a resort town in Wales. When the poster had only been up for a couple of weeks, those living in the area took it upon themselves to change it. The woman’s body was drawn on, and the sexual innuendoes present in the ad were enhanced. There was more than one participant in the defacing of the ad, making the whole series of events a protest of sorts against the idea that a perfect, pure, “sunny” life is possible.","Come To Sunny Prestatyn
Laughed the girl on the poster,
Kneeling up on the sand 
In tautened white satin. 
Behind her, a hunk of coast, a
Hotel with palms
Seemed to expand from her thighs and 
Spread breast-lifting arms.

She was slapped up one day in March. 
A couple of weeks, and her face
Was snaggle-toothed and boss-eyed; 
Huge tits and a fissured crotch
Were scored well in, and the space 
Between her legs held scrawls
That set her fairly astride
A tuberous cock and balls

Autographed Titch Thomas, while 
Someone had used a knife
Or something to stab right through 
The moustached lips of her smile. 
She was too good for this life. 
Very soon, a great transverse tear 
Left only a hand and some blue. 
Now Fight Cancer is there.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48415/sunny-prestatyn
Requiem by Robert Louis Stevenson,Robert Louis Stevenson,"'Requiem' by Robert Louis Stevenson is a short poem that describes someone's wishes after they pass away. The poem starts with a stanza describing the landscape in which the speaker wants to be buried. He wants to be somewhere peaceful, away from the city and under the stars. His wishes are fulfilled, the second stanza indicates. This is seen through a three-line inscription that's included in the third stanza of what “you” chose to write on the speaker's grave.","Under the wide and starry sky,
Dig the grave and let me lie.
Glad did I live and gladly die,
And I laid me down with a will.
This be the verse you grave for me:
Here he lies where he longed to be;
Home is the sailor, home from sea,
And the hunter home from the hill.",https://poets.org/poem/requiem
Skyscraper by Carl Sandburg,Carl Sandburg,"'Skyscraper' by Carl Sandburg is a vivid poem that describes a day within the skyscraper, each of its twenty floors. In this piece, the beauty of the Chicago city is described through the eyes of the skyscraper. Due to its magnificence, it attracts a number of people from distant places. Sandburg praises the role every section played in building this remarkable building. He includes every small worker who laid their hands and sweat in the construction of the skyscraper. Through this poem, Sandburg shows how vital the role of an individual is and how they can make a noticeable mark in the modern world. He also talks about the pain one underwent while making the building and how they are left unrecognized. Sandburg personifies the building and begins by saying that the building “has a soul.” He glorifies a day within the walls of the skyscraper and praises those who worked day and night to keep the skyscraper standing straight and firm. He indirectly indicates to society and hints at the vital role played by an individual in building the nation. Just like the building is left without soul as the day ends, so is the nation without people. Thus, people are the soul of a nation. Overall, in this poem, he meditates on the mortality of humans and the enduring nature of man-made buildings.","BY day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and
has a soul.
Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into
it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are
poured out again back to the streets, prairies and
valleys.
It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and
out all day that give the building a soul of dreams
and thoughts and memories.
(Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care
for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman
the way to it?)
Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and
parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and
sewage out.
Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,
and tell terrors and profits and loves--curses of men
grappling plans of business and questions of women
in plots of love.
Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the
earth and hold the building to a turning planet.
Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and
hold together the stone walls and floors.
Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the
mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an
architect voted.
Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,
and the press of time running into centuries, play
on the building inside and out and use it.
Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid
in graves where the wind whistles a wild song
without words
And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes
and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.
Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging
at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-
layer who went to state's prison for shooting another
man while drunk.
(One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the
end of a straight plunge--he is here--his soul has
gone into the stones of the building.)
On the office doors from tier to tier--hundreds of names
and each name standing for a face written across
with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving
ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's
ease of life.
Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls
tell nothing from room to room.
Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from
corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,
and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all
ends of the earth.
Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of
the building just the same as the master-men who
rule the building.
Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor
empties its men and women who go away and eat
and come back to work.
Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and
all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on
them.
One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed
elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers
work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water
and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,
and machine grime of the day.
Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling
miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for
money. The sign speaks till midnight.
Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence
holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor
and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip
pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money
is stacked in them.
A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights
of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of
red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span
of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of
crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.
By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars
and has a soul.",http://carl-sandburg.com/skyscraper.htm
Harlem Hopscotch by Maya Angelou,Maya Angelou,"'Harlem Hopscotch' by Maya Angelou is a memorable poem that uses an extended metaphor to speak about the Black experience. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing what playing hopscotch is like. The pavement is hot, and so, you have to jump into the air, trying not to put both feet on the ground. She makes several allusions to the nature of the world by suggesting that good things come to those who can afford them and that “Everybody” has to be for “hisself.” The speaker makes it clear that this is more than a game of hopscotch. She's also using it to define the Black experience. Since the players are Black, they have to keep moving. Soon they'll be out of food and need to pay rent. Jobs are hard to come by, and everyone, like the hopscotch players, are contorting themselves to try to make ends meet. If you land with both feet on the ground, the game is over. The speaker concludes by saying that some believe this means she's lost the game, but she thinks it means she's won.","One foot down, then hop! It's hot.
Good things for the ones that's got.
Another jump, now to the left.
Everybody for hisself.

In the air, now both feet down.
Since you black, don't stick around.
Food is gone, the rent is due,
Curse and cry and then jump two.

All the people out of work,
Hold for three, then twist and jerk.
Cross the line, they count you out.
That's what hopping's all about.

Both feet flat, the game is done.
They think I lost. I think I won.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/harlem-hopscotch/
When Earth’s Last Picture Is Painted by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling,"In 'When Earth's Last Picture Is Painted,' Rudyard Kipling compares the new world to a painting and describes how the “last picture” will be drawn in the last days on earth. In this poem, Kipling paints a dystopian image of a world where the colors of the “old” have faded, and the “youngest critic” of art has died. The speaker says that after the end of the world, people would rest in their graves for an æon or more until there is a new beginning. Those who were good during their lifetime will be rewarded and given a seat in the “golden chair.” They will be the first painters to draw on a “ten-league canvas” provided by God. Their painting would take inspiration from saints. In the process of completing the picture, they will never grow tired. In the last stanza, Kipling refers back to how only God's praise and approval matter to these people most, not “money” or “fame.”","When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,
When the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died,
We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an aeon or two,
Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew.

And those that were good shall be happy; they shall sit in a golden chair;
They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair.
They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;
They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!

And only The Master shall praise us, and only The Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,
But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,
Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They are!",kiplingsociety.co.uk/poem/poems_earthslast.htm
Elegy V: His Picture by John Donne,John Donne,"'Elegy V' by John Donne is dedicated to a changing relationship moving beyond physical attraction to a strong, emotional connection. In the first part of the poem, the poet begins by telling his lover to take a picture he's given her and use to remember him by while he's gone on a trip. He knows that the trip is going to be long and that when he comes back, he's going to look and feel different. He tells her that he can use the picture to show those who question her about their relationship what he looked like when they fell in love. He believes he'll no longer be the attractive young man she once knew. Their relationship is going to hinge on their internal, emotional connection. This will take them into the next stage of their life, and their relationship will be far stronger and more dependable than a simple attraction to what the other person looks like.","Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
""Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.""",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44100/elegy-v-his-picture
Sonnet 100 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'Sonnet 100 ' by William Shakespeare marks a turn in Shakespeare's Fair Youth series in which he implores his muse to inspire him. Throughout this poem, the speaker addresses his muse and chastises them for leaving him. He feels as though he's been abandoned by his ability to write sufficiently about his beloved, the Fair Youth. The speaker asks the muse to come back to him and allow him to write as he once did. He still hopes to immortalize this young man so that time's knife never touches him.","Where art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long,
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
Rise, resty Muse, my love’s sweet face survey,
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
If any, be a satire to decay,
And make time’s spoils despised every where.
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
So thou prevent’st his scythe and crooked knife.",https://nosweatshakespeare.com/sonnets/100/
Synopsis of the Great Welsh Novel by Harri Webb,Harri Webb,"Synopsis of the Great Welsh Novel' by Harri Webb describes through humorous verse the state of Welsh society and culture. The poem begins with the speaker stating that there is a man who lives somewhere which may nor may not be flooded, named Dai K. This person and his relatives, are simply described. There is not much detail put into any character mentioned in this short narrative. The next section speaks on how all the women in the town are pregnant and all the residents have been subject to a religious revival. Eventually, a strange and famous man comes to visit the town, throwing off the already out of balance landscape. In the final section, the speaker describes how most people, especially the young, have left Wales. All who remain are like Ianto who reads to confused sheep and then jumps to his death.","Dai K lives at the end of a valley. One is not quite sure
whether it has been drowned or not. His Mam

After a performance of Elijah, the mad preacher
Davies the Doom has burnt the chapel down.
One Saturday night after the dance at the Con Club,
With the Free Wales Army up to no good in the back lanes,

God, the well known television personality. He succeeds
In confusing the issue, whatever it is, and departs
On the last train before the line is closed.

Involving all the most respected citizens; the Choir
Wins at the National. It is all seen, naturally,
Through the eyes of a sensitive boy who never grows up.
The men emigrate to America, Cardiff and the moon. The girls
Find rich and foolish English husbands. Only daft Ianto

Please Mrs. Butler by Allan Ahlberg,Allan Ahlberg,"'Please Mrs. Butler' by Allan Ahlberg is a simple and amusing children's poem. The poem is divided into three parts. The first contains a young student's plea for her teacher to stop one of their fellow students from copying their work. Rather than provide a solution, the teacher dismisses the issue and tries to get the student to solve it themselves. Throughout, the poet uses amusing and outrageous language that is meant to entertain, especially in the teacher's rather outlandish suggestions. The third part of the poem progresses in the same way, with the final issue being raised in the fifth stanza and amusingly dismissed in the sixth.","Please Mrs Butler

Sonnet 111 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'Sonnet 111' by William Shakespeare describes the speaker's opinion of himself and the cure he's seeking. In the first lines of 'Sonnet 111,' the speaker begins by addressing Fortune. He is chastising Fortune for not providing him with the life he wanted. He is forced to cater to the public's whims. His success is based on their interest in him. The speaker feels that this has degraded him somehow, and he compares himself to a dyer who gets their own dye on their hands. This sullies him, and he's attempting to cure himself of it. The speaker is willing to take whatever medicine he needs to, no matter how bitter. But, he concludes, the Fair Youth's affections are the best possible medicine he could conceive of.","O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds.
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
No bitterness that I will bitter think,
Nor double penance, to correct correction.
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45105/sonnet-111-o-for-my-sake-do-you-with-fortune-chide
I Hear An Army by James Joyce,James Joyce,"‘I Hear An Army’ captures the feeling of lost love through intense imagery and the use of musical patterns. In the poem, there is a description of a group of charioteers, riding out of the sea and approaching the lyrical voice that culminates with the thought of yearned affection.","I hear an army charging upon the land, And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees: Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand, Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers. They cry unto the night their battle-name: I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter. They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame, Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil. They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair: They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore. My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair? My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?",https://poets.org/poem/i-hear-army
The Moon and the Yew Tree by Sylvia Plath,Sylvia Plath,"The Moon and the Yew Tree' by Sylvia Plath is a complex and autobiographical poem that describes the poet's relationship with her parents. The poem takes the reader through a series of images that outline her other as the moon and her father as a yew tree. Neither of these forces did Plath any good in her life. The poet begins the poem by speaking about her mind and the coldness and darkness she can find within it. There is grief that is thrust upon her and no access to the world of warmth that should await her at home. When talking about her mother, the poet describes the moon. It has a “face in its own right” and no interest in providing Plath with a “door” to reach love, home, or happiness. The yew tree has a “Gothic shape” and is nothing more than “blackness and silence”. These are the two main images of her parents which are included alongside a cold and distant relationship with religion.","This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary
The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.
The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God
Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility
Fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place.
Separated from my house by a row of headstones.
I simply cannot see where there is to get to.

The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right,
White as a knuckle and terribly upset.
It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet
With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here.
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky --
Eight great tongues affirming the Resurrection
At the end, they soberly bong out their names.
The yew tree points up, it has a Gothic shape.
The eyes lift after it and find the moon.
The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary.
Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls.
How I would like to believe in tenderness -
The face of the effigy, gentled by candles,
Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes.

I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering
Blue and mystical over the face of the stars
Inside the church, the saints will all be blue,
Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,
Their hands and faces stiff with holiness.
The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild.
And the message of the yew tree is blackness - blackness and silence.",https://genius.com/Sylvia-plath-the-moon-and-the-yew-tree-annotated
In Praise of Limestone by W. H. Auden,W.H. Auden,"'In Praise of Limestone' is a philosophical poem of life. It elaborates on the close existence of human life with nature. It explores human transformation with nature and vice versa. 'In Praise of Limestone' is a depiction of human growth and bond with limestone panorama. It specializes in a reasonable atmosphere for stability in this world. Auden explicitly presents the intense natures of human beings through the intense climates of the world. Through the images and metaphor, the poet correlates the inconsistency of limestone to the inconsistency of human. The limestone dissolves in water, for it has not a flexible nature, similarly, humans who are not flexible will be forgotten in history. The poet touches upon the humans being immortal, imperfect, and faithless to one another. The poet alludes to the statues and sculptures of humble saints and warriors/kings, who had a remarkable life. He concludes the poem with the note that one doesn't need to change places but they can adapt to the situation that prevails.","If it form the one landscape that we, the inconstant ones,
Are consistently homesick for, this is chiefly
Because it dissolves in water. Mark these rounded slopes
With their surface fragrance of thyme and, beneath,
A secret system of caves and conduits; hear the springs
That spurt out everywhere with a chuckle,
Each filling a private pool for its fish and carving
Its own little ravine whose cliffs entertain
The butterfly and the lizard; examine this region
Of short distances and definite places:
What could be more like Mother or a fitter background
For her son, the flirtatious male who lounges
Against a rock in the sunlight, never doubting
That for all his faults he is loved; whose works are but
Extensions of his power to charm? From weathered outcrop
To hill-top temple, from appearing waters to
Conspicuous fountains, from a wild to a formal vineyard,
Are ingenious but short steps that a child's wish
To receive more attention than his brothers, whether
By pleasing or teasing, can easily take.
Watch, then, the band of rivals as they climb up and down
Their steep stone gennels in twos and threes, at times
Arm in arm, but never, thank God, in step; or engaged
On the shady side of a square at midday in
Voluble discourse, knowing each other too well to think
There are any important secrets, unable
To conceive a god whose temper-tantrums are moral
And not to be pacified by a clever line
Or a good lay: for accustomed to a stone that responds,
They have never had to veil their faces in awe
Of a crater whose blazing fury could not be fixed;
Adjusted to the local needs of valleys
Where everything can be touched or reached by walking,
Their eyes have never looked into infinite space
Through the lattice-work of a nomad's comb; born lucky,
Their legs have never encountered the fungi
And insects of the jungle, the monstrous forms and lives
With which we have nothing, we like to hope, in common.
So, when one of them goes to the bad, the way his mind works
Remains incomprehensible: to become a pimp
Or deal in fake jewellery or ruin a fine tenor voice
For effects that bring down the house, could happen to all
But the best and the worst of us…
That is why, I suppose,
The best and worst never stayed here long but sought
Immoderate soils where the beauty was not so external,
The light less public and the meaning of life
Something more than a mad camp. 'Come!' cried the granite wastes,
""How evasive is your humour, how accidental
Your kindest kiss, how permanent is death."" (Saints-to-be
Slipped away sighing.) ""Come!"" purred the clays and gravels,
""On our plains there is room for armies to drill; rivers
Wait to be tamed and slaves to construct you a tomb
In the grand manner: soft as the earth is mankind and both
Need to be altered."" (Intendant Caesars rose and
Left, slamming the door.) But the really reckless were fetched
By an older colder voice, the oceanic whisper:
""I am the solitude that asks and promises nothing;
That is how I shall set you free. There is no love;
There are only the various envies, all of them sad.""
They were right, my dear, all those voices were right
And still are; this land is not the sweet home that it looks,
Nor its peace the historical calm of a site
Where something was settled once and for all: A back ward
And dilapidated province, connected
To the big busy world by a tunnel, with a certain
Seedy appeal, is that all it is now? Not quite:
It has a worldy duty which in spite of itself
It does not neglect, but calls into question
All the Great Powers assume; it disturbs our rights. The poet,
Admired for his earnest habit of calling
The sun the sun, his mind Puzzle, is made uneasy
By these marble statues which so obviously doubt
His antimythological myth; and these gamins,
Pursuing the scientist down the tiled colonnade
With such lively offers, rebuke his concern for Nature's
Remotest aspects: I, too, am reproached, for what
And how much you know. Not to lose time, not to get caught,
Not to be left behind, not, please! to resemble
The beasts who repeat themselves, or a thing like water
Or stone whose conduct can be predicted, these
Are our common prayer, whose greatest comfort is music
Which can be made anywhere, is invisible,
And does not smell. In so far as we have to look forward
To death as a fact, no doubt we are right: But if
Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead,
These modifications of matter into
Innocent athletes and gesticulating fountains,
Made solely for pleasure, make a further point:
The blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from,
Having nothing to hide. Dear, I know nothing of
Either, but when I try to imagine a faultless love
Or the life to come, what I hear is the murmur
Of underground streams, what I see is a limestone landscape",https://allpoetry.com/In-Praise-Of-Limestone
Bei Hennef by D.H. Lawrence,D.H. Lawrence,"'Bei Hennef' by D.H. Lawrence is a love poem in which the speaker considers the irritations and restrictions of the real world. The poet's speaker addresses the beautiful scene he's experiencing in the first lines of 'Bei Hennef.' He describes the twilight, the river, and how far away he feels from his every day worries. This is something that allows him to think clearly in a way he can't when he's going about his mundane routine. Now, he can look around him and at his love and know how pure and full it is. He loves the intended listener of this poem, “you,” fully and completely. He knows now that the two complete one another. Despite this, he concludes, they still suffer from the annoyances of reality, and their love isn't as strong as it could be on a day to day basis.","The little river twittering in the twilight,
The wan, wondering look of the pale sky,
This is almost bliss.
And everything shut up and gone to sleep,
All the troubles and anxieties and pain
Gone under the twilight.
Only the twilight now, and the soft “Sh!” of the river
That will last forever.
And at last I know my love for you is here,
I can see it all, it is whole like the twilight,
It is large, so large, I could not see it before
Because of the little lights and flickers and interruptions,
Troubles, anxieties, and pains.
You are the call and I am the answer,
You are the wish, and I the fulfillment,
You are the night, and I the day.
What else—it is perfect enough,
It is perfectly complete,
You and I.
Strange, how we suffer in spite of this!",https://poets.org/poem/bei-hennef
Silent Poem by Robert Francis,Robert Francis,"'Silent Poem' by Robert Francis is an unusual poem that uses compound words to describe rural life, a wooded landscape, and allusions to death. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by listing out a few compound words that describe a natural, wooded landscape. It is unclear where the speaker is, who they are, or how exactly they feel about their surroundings. But, their focus on imagery suggests that they care about nature and respect the rural lifestyle, which becomes clearer as the poem progresses. In the next lines, the speaker introduces more human-related imagery. This includes examples of farm equipment, structures one might find on a farm, and other objects one could encounter there. The poem concludes with a few compound words that suggest the end of the day or the end of life.","backroad leafmold stonewall chipmunk

Incident by Natasha Trethewey,Natasha Trethewey,"Incident' by Natasha Trethewey tells a story that is retold each year in the speaker's family concerning the burning of the cross “trussed like a Christmas tree”. The speaker of this piece informs readers that the story which she is going to tell is familiar to their family. It is a true story and her family witnessed that fearful event on a night. They peered from their windows and tried to look at the happenings outside. By drawing the shades, they watched through the charred glass. A group of men dressed in white costumes gathered around a cross trussed like a Christmas tree. They put it on fire and left the place. Those who were inside their houses (including the speaker and her family) watched the fiery show throughout the night, in the trembling light of a hurricane lamp.","We tell the story every year—
how we peered from the windows, shades drawn—
though nothing really happened,
the charred grass now green again.
We peered from the windows, shades drawn,
at the cross trussed like a Christmas tree,
the charred grass still green. Then
we darkened our rooms, lit the hurricane lamps.
At the cross trussed like a Christmas tree,
a few men gathered, white as angels in their gowns.
We darkened our rooms and lit hurricane lamps,
the wicks trembling in their fonts of oil.
It seemed the angels had gathered, white men in their gowns.
When they were done, they left quietly. No one came.
The wicks trembled all night in their fonts of oil;
by morning the flames had all dimmed.
When they were done, the men left quietly. No one came.
Nothing really happened.
By morning all the flames had dimmed.
We tell the story every year.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/incident-10/
The Rhodora by Ralph Waldo Emerson,Ralph Waldo Emerson,"The Rhodora' by Ralph Waldo Emerson describes the power of a rhododendron flower and its ability to outshine and improve, all the elements around it. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he was once walking through the woods on a windy day in May. The weather was not great, and the woods through which he traveled were bleak. That is until came upon the “fresh Rhodora,” or rhododendron. The brightness of the petals this flower illuminated everything around it. The dark water was made gay and the birds put to shame for their lack of brilliance. In the second half, the speaker describes the power of simple beauty. As well as how the flower exists for no other reason than to be beautiful. One has eyes to gaze upon such things, but they do not grow for humankind.","In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,

I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,

Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,

To please the desert and the sluggish brook.

The purple petals fallen in the pool

Made the black water with their beauty gay;

Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,

And court the flower that cheapens his array.

Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why

This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,

Tell them, dear, that, if eyes were made for seeing,

Then beauty is its own excuse for Being;

Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!

I never thought to ask; I never knew;

But in my simple ignorance suppose

The self-same power that brought me there, brought you.",https://poets.org/poem/rhodora
Sex Without Love by Sharon Olds,Sharon Olds,"'Sex Without Love' by Sharon Olds describes relationships in which a couple engages in sex without a deeper emotional connection. The poem takes the reader through similes and metaphors that compare lovers, those who “make love” without being “in love,” to a variety of actions and objects. They are like “red steak” and gliding ice-skaters. These men and women move through life without commitment and in full knowledge of their solitary existence.","How do they do it, the ones who make love
without love? Beautiful as dancers,
gliding over each other like ice-skaters
over the ice, fingers hooked
inside each other's bodies, faces
red as steak, wine, wet as the
children at birth whose mothers are going to
give them away. How do they come to the
come to the come to the God come to the
still waters, and not love
the one who came there with them, light
rising slowly as steam off their joined
skin? These are the true religious,
the purists, the pros, the ones who will not
accept a false Messiah, love the
priest instead of the God. They do not
mistake the lover for their own pleasure,
they are like great runners: they know they are alone
with the road surface, the cold, the wind,
the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio-
vascular health--just factors, like the partner
in the bed, and not the truth, which is the
single body alone in the universe
against its own best time.",http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/sharon_olds/poems/19521
America by Claude Mckay,Claude McKay,"America' by Claude McKay explores the simultaneous horrors and brilliance of America. Beginning with what is bad about the country, McKay quickly says that he loves it. The poet understands that it is a country that has a quality that inspires strength and passion, although there are certainly many bits that do the opposite. The poem is at once a critique and a love letter to the United States of America.","Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth.
Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,
Giving me strength erect against her hate,
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
Yet, as a rebel fronts a king in state,
I stand within her walls with not a shred
Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,
And see her might and granite wonders there,
Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44691/america-56d223e1ac025
In Tenebris: I by Thomas Hardy,Thomas Hardy,"In Tenebris: I' by Thomas Hardy describes a speaker's depressed emotional state and his inability to impacted by changes in the season or traumatic loss. The majority of this piece is made up o statements about the state of the environment followed by three lines about the speaker's own experience. Winter is approaching throughout this piece. It never arrives, but is seen to kill the leaves, flowers, and dull down the colors of the world. While to many this would be a depressing sight, alongside the deaths of friends and the loss of love, the speaker is not changed by it. He is so deep into his own mental depression there is nothing that can pull him out of it. It gives him a backward kind of strength as well as there is no further down he can sink. He is at the bottom of every possible emotion. The poem concludes with his description of the “unhope” he is waiting in. There is no end in sight to his predicament, he is trapped. Read more of Thomas Hardy's poems.","Wintertime nighs;
But my bereavement-pain
It cannot bring again:
Twice no one dies.

Flower-petals flee;
But, since it once hath been,
No more that severing scene
Can harrow me.

Birds faint in dread:
I shall not lose old strength
In the lone frost's black length:
Strength long since fled!

Leaves freeze to dun;
But friends can not turn cold
This season as of old
For him with none.

Tempests may scath;
But love can not make smart
Again this year his heart
Who no heart hath.

Black is night's cope;
But death will not appal
One who, past doubtings all,
Waits in unhope.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/44328/in-tenebris
A Conceit by Maya Angelou,Maya Angelou,"‘A Conceit’ is a brief, but blunt, piece in which Angelou utilizes a commanding tone and staunch comparisons to indicate she is not interested in a superficial relationship or a fixation with the pain that one can bring. This adds a level of importance to her desires and strengthens the message of the poem that tangible and real are superior to superficial and despondent.","Give me your hand

Let others have
the privacy of
touching words
and love of loss
of love.

Night Sweat by Robert Lowell,Robert Lowell,"'Night Sweat' by Robert Lowell talks about the speaker's anguish and frustration as he struggles with “life's fever”. 'Night Sweat' by Robert Lowell is an emotionally complex poem. It's not clear why the speaker is suffering from night sweats. The metaphorical meaning of “my stalled equipment” makes it clear that the speaker is going through writer's block. The downward glide of his ability and his previous bias are blocking him to pen down that “one writing”. However, in the next section of the poem, the poet says his wife's presence lightens his mind. She has such a personality that even makes the plain things of his room cheerful. At last, he requests his dear wife to redeem him from his anguish and frustration as she has done before.","Work-table, litter, books and standing lamp,
plain things, my stalled equipment, the old broom---
but I am living in a tidied room,
for ten nights now I've felt the creeping damp
float over my pajamas' wilted white . . .
Sweet salt embalms me and my head is wet,
everything streams and tells me this is right;
my life's fever is soaking in night sweat---
one life, one writing! But the downward glide
and bias of existing wrings us dry---
always inside me is the child who died,
always inside me is his will to die---
one universe, one body . . . in this urn
the animal night sweats of the spirit burn.
Behind me! You! Again I feel the light
lighten my leaded eyelids, while the gray
skulled horses whinny for the soot of night.
I dabble in the dapple of the day,
a heap of wet clothes, seamy, shivering,
I see my flesh and bedding washed with light,
my child exploding into dynamite,
my wife . . . your lightness alters everything,
and tears the black web from the spider's sack,
as your heart hops and flutters like a hare.
Poor turtle, tortoise, if I cannot clear
the surface of these troubled waters here,
absolve me, help me, Dear Heart, as you bear
this world's dead weight and cycle on your back.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/14110271-Night-Sweat-by-Robert-Lowell
A Woman Waits for Me by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"'A Woman Waits for Me' by Walt Whitman describes how to forge the ideal relationship out of which the perfect offspring is born. This Whitman poem is not merely about the act of procreation itself. Rather it is about the act of creation, particularly the way a perfect child is born, nurtured, and guided. The poem begins with a speaker describing how a perfect woman without lacking anything waits for him. Then he goes on to describe the act of sex and how it is all-inclusive. He particularly waits for the women who are passionate, “warm-blooded,” and “sufficient” for him. They are the ones who could bear the children of the future and nurture the qualities of the speaker within them. His creative energy is what he intends to plant in the hearts of the women who wait for none other than him.","A woman waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking,
Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the right man were lacking.

Sex contains all, bodies, souls,
Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,
Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk,
All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,
All the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth,
These are contain'd in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself.

Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,
Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.

Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,
I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,
I see that they understand me and do not deny me,
I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of those women.

They are not one jot less than I am,
They are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,
Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,
They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,
They are ultimate in their own right—they are calm, clear, well-possess'd of themselves.

I draw you close to me, you women,
I cannot let you go, I would do you good,
I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for others' sakes,
Envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards,
They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.

It is I, you women, I make my way,
I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,
I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,
I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I press with slow rude muscle,
I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,
I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me.

Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,
In you I wrap a thousand onward years,
On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,
The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,
The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,
I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,
I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you interpenetrate now,
I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,
I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality, I plant so lovingly now.",https://poets.org/poem/woman-waits-me
All the world’s a stage by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'All the world's a stage' is a monologue of “the melancholy Jaques” from Act II Scene VII of the play As You Like It by William Shakespeare. The speaker, Jacques, begins “All the world's a stage” by asserting that life is like a stage on which “men and women merely” play roles. They play different parts throughout their lives, as the speaker is now. In the bulk of this monologue, the speaker spends time going through the seven ages of man. One starts in infancy, moves through childhood, and into the best part of their life when they're a lover, soldier, and judge. Later, they lose control of their senses and eventually can't take care of themselves. You can read the full speech here with the analysis or watch Benedict Cumberbatch recite 'All the world's a stage'. The Globe Theatre in London where As You Like It would've been performed in the early 1600s.","All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/56966/speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage
The River God by Stevie Smith,Stevie Smith,"One of the most fascinating elements of poetry that is largely non-existent in other art forms is its capacity to personify non-living entities into relatable, admirable, or deplorable characters. When a poem is able to make the natural world a character to root for or to dislike, it opens up countless dimensions of poetic intrigue that is unparalleled by most art. Stevie Smith’s ‘The River God’ gives away its main concept directly in the title — as a river cannot be a divine entity of any sort, the reader can expect the personification of the river into a godlike entity. For a poem to be able to create that analogy gives it a unique form and power, and Smith’s use of poetic devices to form her river character is done extremely well, for the creation of a poem just as powerful as its namesake.","I may be smelly, and I may be old,
Rough in my pebbles, reedy in my pools,
But where my fish float by I bless their swimming
And I like the people to bathe in me, especially women.
But I can drown the fools
Who bathe too close to the weir, contrary to rules.
And they take their time drowning
As I throw them up now and then in a spirit of clowning.
Hi yih, yippity-yap, merrily I flow,
O I may be an old foul river but I have plenty of go.
Once there was a lady who was too bold
She bathed in me by the tall black cliff where the water runs cold,
So I brought her down here
To be my beautiful dear.
Oh will she stay with me will she stay
This beautiful lady, or will she go away?
She lies in my beautiful deep river bed with many a weed
To hold her, and many a waving reed.
Oh who would guess what a beautiful white face lies there
Waiting for me to smooth and wash away the fear
She looks at me with. Hi yih, do not let her
Go. There is no one on earth who does not forget her
Now. They say I am a foolish old smelly river
But they do not know of my wide original bed
Where the lady waits, with her golden sleepy head.
If she wishes to go I will not forgive her.",https://genius.com/Stevie-smith-the-river-god-annotated
Africa by Maya Angelou,Maya Angelou,"Africa' by Maya Angelou describes the plight of the African continent through the extended metaphor of a beautiful woman. The poem begins with the speaker stating that Africa is a woman who has deserts for hair and “mountains” for breasts. She is truly beautiful and incredibly strong. The next lines become darker. Brigands arrive on the shores of the continent and take everything in sight. The women are raped and the men sold into the slave trade. Culture is destroyed and Africa is metaphorically on the ground. In the final stanza the woman, embodying the continent, stands up. She screams out everything that has occurred and refuses to be put down for a moment longer. Africa strides out from her past of death into a new, stronger future.","Thus she had lain

golden her feet

two Niles her tears.
Thus she has lain

Because You Asked about the Line Between Prose and Poetry by Howard Nemerov,Howard Nemerov,'Because You Asked about the Line Between Prose and Poetry' by Howard Nemerov is a thoughtful depiction of the differences alluded to in the title. The poem uses a snowy and rainy scene and the images of birds feeding to define the difference between “prose and poetry.” It is not a clear or obvious difference but one that requires some analysis to understand. This is part of the poet's way of suggesting how poems are different from prose work. They require more interpretation and may leave the reader without a clear understanding of what every image means.,"Sparrows were feeding in a freezing drizzle
That while you watched turned to pieces of snow
Riding a gradient invisible
From silver aslant to random, white, and slow.

Wine Tasting by Kim Addonizio,Kim Addonizio,"'Wine Tasting' by Kim Addonizio is a powerful poem that addresses the interconnectivity of memory and experience. In the first lines of 'Wine Tasting,' the speaker describes what memories come to mind while drinking wine. They are connected to the smell and taste of cracked leather and cherries. She moves on, bringing in the thoughts and experiences of Li Bai, a friend, and then again her own. The poem concludes with the speaker suggesting that the temporary nature of this kind of experience makes it all the more moving.","I think I detect cracked leather.
I’m pretty sure I smell the cherries
from a Shirley Temple my father bought me

in 1959, in a bar in Orlando, Florida,
and the chlorine from my mother’s bathing cap.
And last winter’s kisses, like salt on black ice,

like the moon slung away from the earth.
When Li Po drank wine, the moon dove
in the river, and he staggered after.

Probably he tasted laughter.
When my friend Susan drinks
she cries because she’s Irish

and childless. I’d like to taste,
one more time, the rain that arrived
one afternoon and fell just short

of where I stood, so I leaned my face in,
alive in both worlds at once,
knowing it would end and not caring.",https://poets.org/poem/wine-tasting
There was a time when my cheek burned by Emily Brontë,Emily Brontë,"'There was a time when my cheek burned' by Emily Brontë is a poem about truth and the world's inability to change. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker begins by describing how when they were young, they would've died for the truth. They wanted to fight and rid the world of injustice, fools, and selfish people. But they're older now and have realized that pure passion and anger will not change the world. They've had to accept that the world is how it is.","There was a time when my cheek burned
To give such scornful fiends the lie;
Ungoverned nature madly spurned
The law that bade it not defy.
O in the days of ardent youth
I would have given my life for truth.

For truth, for right, for liberty,
I would have gladly, freely died;
And now I calmly hear and see
The vain man smile, the fool deride;
Though not because my heart is tame,
Though not for fear, though not for shame.

My soul still chafes at every tone
Of selfish and self-blinded error;
My breast still braves the world alone,
Steeled as it ever was to terror;

Elegy Before Death by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"'Elegy Before Death' is about the physical and spiritual impact of a loss and how it can and cannot change one's world. This poem is told from the perspective of a second person narrator directing their statements at an undefined “you.” The poem begins by describing how the world will be the same after this person has passed on. There will still be “rose and rhododendron” (1) and the “sunny sound” (4) of bees will still “be heard from white syringas” (3). Additional creatures and plants will go on as they always have, as will the seasons. Time will not stop for the world. The only physical things that will be disturbed are the simple weeds on the gravesite and the land that this person's spirit will walk after death. The poem concludes by calling this passing a “great” one (21) and making clear that while the world is not physically changed, it will be essentially changed for the speaker. The spark of beauty and magic in “common water” (23) and “simple stone” (24) will leave along with “you”.","There will be rose and rhododendron
When you are dead and under ground;
Still will be heard from white syringas
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
Still will the tamaracks be raining
After the rain has ceased, and still
Will there be robins in the stubble,
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
Nothing will know that you are gone,
Saving alone some sullen plough-land
None but yourself sets foot upon;
Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
Nothing will know that you are dead,—
These, and perhaps a useless wagon
Standing beside some tumbled shed.
Oh, there will pass with your great passing
Little of beauty not your own,—
Only the light from common water,
Only the grace from simple stone!",https://poets.org/poem/elegy-death
"July 4, 1974 by June Jordan",June Jordan,"July 4, 1974' by June Jordan begins by focusing on the birth of Jordan's son, 'some/sixteen years ago' in a hospital in 'New York'. The current date when Jordan writes, 1974 is 16 years after the birth of her son in 1958. The first stanza is designated to these facts and statistics, those which comprise the newborn's life. The poem then moves into Jordan's preparedness for motherhood, with the poem becoming more abstract. The final two stanzas of the poem discuss the child as he grows, becoming his own distinct personality. The final word of the poem focuses on 'light', with motherhood being some Jordan prides herself on.","At least it helps me to think about my son

Stanzas for Music by Lord Byron,Lord Byron,"'Stanzas for Music' by Lord Byron contains the words of a speaker who believes their beloved has a spiritual divinity and power over the ocean. The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader, and the person with whom they are in love, that no one, not even “Beauty's daughters” can compare to this person's beauty. They are never definitively described as man or woman, but, they are clearly seen as god-like, unbelievably powerful, and influential in the speaker's life. Byron spends the bulk of this short, lyrical and clearly musical sixteen line poem using natural images such as the “midnight moon” and the deepest parts of the ocean to convey the speaker's love.","There be none of Beauty's daughters
With a magic like thee;
And like music on the waters
Is thy sweet voice to me:
When, as if its sound were causing
The charmed ocean's pausing,
The waves lie still and gleaming,
And the lull'd winds seem dreaming:
And the midnight moon is weaving
Her bright chain o'er the deep;
Whose breast is gently heaving,
As an infant's asleep:
So the spirit bows before thee,
To listen and adore thee;
With a full but soft emotion,
Like the swell of Summer's ocean.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43846/stanzas-for-music
Blues for Almost Forgotten Music by Roxanne Beth Johnson,Roxane Beth Johnson,"'Blues for Almost forgotten Music' by Roxanne Beth Johnson uses remembering music as a metaphor for looking back over parts of a relationship. For Johnson, a happy relationship is like a 'musical' or 'hymn', the music is harmonious and great. Yet, just like music, relationships can be forgotten and fade over time. Johnson uses this idea of 'forgotten music' to discuss past relationships, their passion never fading, only being thought of less and less.","I am trying to remember the lyrics of old songs
I’ve forgotten, mostly
I am trying to remember one-hit wonders, hymns,
and musicals like West Side Story.
Singing over and over what I can recall, I hum remnants on
buses and in the car.
I am so often alone these days with echoes of these old songs
and my ghosted lovers.
I am so often alone that I can almost hear it, can almost feel
the half-touch of others,
can almost taste the licked clean spine of the melody I’ve lost.
I remember the records rubbed with static and the needle
gathering dust.
I remember the taste of a mouth so sudden and still cold from
wintry gusts.
It seemed incredible then — a favorite song, a love found.
It wasn't, after all.
Days later, while vacuuming, the lyrics come without thinking.
Days later, I think I see my old lover in a café but don’t,
how pleasing
it was to think it was him, to finally sing that song.
This is the way of all amplitude: we need the brightness
to die some.
This is the way of love and music: it plays like a god and
then is done.
Do I feel better remembering, knowing for certain
what’s gone?",poetryfoundation.org/poems/54418/blues-for-almost-forgotten-music
A Trampwoman’s Tragedy by Thomas Hardy,Thomas Hardy,"'A Trampwoman's Tragedy' by Thomas Hardy is a narrative poem that speaks on a number of avoidable deaths brought on by thoughtless teasing. The poem begins with the speaker describing a journey across England. She and three companions were walking through forests, over hills, and thoroughly enjoying the trip. It was a long and hard one, but they had one another. The most important relationship within the group is that between the speaker, the trampwoman, and her lover. These two had been together for a long time and the speaker decided to tease her lover. She did so by pretending that another traveler, Jeering John, had won her over. This progressed until her lover became enraged, demanded to know if she was carrying his child, and murdered Jeering John. His act of violence, and the speaker's acts of thoughtlessness, led to his death by hanging. The speaker miscarried her child and was left alone to wander the landscape. The only moment of peace comes when the ghost of the lover comes to her and finally receives the correct answer to his question. Yes, the baby was his. This allows him to depart to the next life.","From Wynyard's Gap the livelong day,
The livelong day,
We beat afoot the northward way
We had travelled times before.
The sun-blaze burning on our backs,
Our shoulders sticking to our packs,
By fosseway1, fields, and turnpike tracks
We skirted sad Sedge-Moor.

Full twenty miles we jaunted on,
We jaunted on, —
My fancy-man2, and jeering John,
And Mother Lee, and I.
And, as the sun drew down to west,
We climbed the toilsome Polden crest,
And saw, of landskip3 sights the best,
The inn that beamed thereby.

Ay, side by side
Through the Great Forest, Blackmoor4 wide,
And where the Parret ran.
We'd faced the gusts on Mendip ridge,
Had crossed the Yeo unhelped by bridge,
Been stung by every Marshwood midge5,
I and my fancy-man.

Lone inns we loved, my man and I,
My man and I;
'King's Stag', 'Windwhistle' high and dry,
'The Horse' on Hintock Green,
The cosy house at Wynyard's Gap,
'The Hut', renowned on Bredy Knap,
And many another wayside tap
Where folk might sit unseen.

O deadly day,
O deadly day! —
I teased my fancy man in play
And wanton idleness.
I walked alongside jeering John,
I laid his hand my waist upon;
I would not bend my glances on
My lover's dark distress.

Thus Poldon top at last we won,
At last we won,
And gained the inn at sink of sun
Far-famed as 'Marshal's Elm'.
Beneath us figured tor and lea,6
From Mendip to the western sea —
I doubt if any finer sight there be
Within this royal realm.

Inside the settle7 all a-row —
All four a-row
We sat, I next to John, to show
That he had wooed and won.
And then he took me on his knee,
And swore it was his turn to be
My favoured mate, and Mother Lee
Passed to my former one.

Then in a voice I had never heard,
I had never heard,
My only love to me: 'One word,
My lady, if you please!
Whose is the child you are like8 to bear? —
His? After all my months o' care?'
Gods knows 'twas not! But, O despair!
I nodded — still to tease.

Then he sprung, and with his knife —
And with his knife,
He let out jeering Johnny's life,
Yes; there at set of sun.
The slant ray through the window nigh
Gilded John's blood and glazing eye,
Ere scarcely Mother Lee and I
Knew that the deed was done.

The taverns tell the gloomy tale,
The gloomy tale,
How that at Ivel-Chester jail
My love, my sweetheart swung;
Though stained till now by no misdeed
Save one horse ta'en in time of need;
(Blue Jimmy stole right many a steed
Ere his last fling he flung.)

Thereaft I walked the world alone
Alone, alone!
On his death-day I gave my groan
And dropt his dead-born child.
'Twas nigh the jail, beneath a tree,
None tending me; for Mother Lee
Had died at Glaston,9 leaving me
Unfriended on the wild.

And in the night as I lay weak,
As I lay weak,
The leaves a-falling on my cheek,
The red moon low declined —
The ghost of him I'd die to kiss
Rose up and said: 'Ah, tell me this!
Was the child mine, or was it his?
Speak, that I my rest may find!'

O doubt but I told him then,
I told him then,
That I had kept me from all men
Since we joined lips and swore.
Whereat he smiled, and thinned away
As the wind stirred to call up day . . .
— 'Tis past! And here alone I stray
Haunting the Western Moor.",https://victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/pva238.html
After Apple-Picking by Robert Frost,Robert Frost,"‘After Apple-Picking’ by Robert Frost begins with an apple-picker’s thoughts after a day of work. The poem goes on to explore themes of life and death. Having picked apples throughout the day, he is tired now. His day’s work is over, but the task of apple-picking is not yet complete. The speaker tells that his long ladder still stands ‘sticking through a tree’, rising high toward heaven. He seems to have left it there on purpose to do some more apple-picking later.","My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take.
Magnified apples appear and disappear,
Stem end and blossom end,
And every fleck of russet showing clear.
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
The rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in.
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking: I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired.
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.
For all
That struck the earth,
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth.
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
Were he not gone,
The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
Or just some human sleep.",https://poemanalysis.com/robert-frost/after-apple-picking/
The Licorice Fields at Pontefract by John Betjeman,John Betjeman,"'The Licorice Fields at Pontefract' by John Betjeman is a direct, passionate, and descriptive poem about a red-haired woman a speaker met in Pontefract. The poem takes the reader into a speaker's memory. He recalls being in a liquorice, or “licorice,” field. There, he saw a woman who filled him with an immediate passion. The poem takes its time describing how she captured him with her eyes and red hair. There are also fulsome descriptions of the town and an only slightly misdescribed image of liquorice blooms.","In the licorice fields at Pontefract
My love and I did meet
And many a burdened licorice bush
Was blooming round our feet;
Red hair she had and golden skin,
Her sulky lips were shaped for sin,
Her sturdy legs were flannel-slack'd
The strongest legs in Pontefract.

The light and dangling licorice flowers
Gave off the sweetest smells;
From various black Victorian towers
The Sunday evening bells
Came pealing over dales and hills
And tanneries and silent mills
And lowly streets where country stops
And little shuttered corner shops.

She cast her blazing eyes on me
And plucked a licorice leaf;
I was her captive slave and she
My red-haired robber chief.
Oh love! for love I could not speak,
It left me winded, wilting, weak,
And held in brown arms strong and bare
And wound with flaming ropes of hair.",http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/john_betjeman/poems/828
The Forest Path by Lucy Maud Montgomery,Lucy Maud Montgomery,"'The Forest Path' by Lucy Maud Montgomery is a direct and beautiful poem about the natural world and how it should be celebrated. Throughout the lines of this piece, Montgomery's speaker describes a forest and the sights and sounds within it. Rather than directly depicting them, though, she uses Greek mythology to make the forest feel even more magical and otherworldly than it already does. This allows her to allude to Pan, dryads, gnomes, and more.","Oh, the charm of idle dreaming
Where the dappled shadows dance,
All the leafy aisles are teeming
With the lure of old romance!
 
Down into the forest dipping,
Deep and deeper as we go,
One might fancy dryads slipping
Where the white-stemmed birches grow.
 
Lurking gnome and freakish fairy
In the fern may peep and hide . . .
Sure their whispers low and airy
Ring us in on every side!
 
Saw you where the pines are rocking
Nymph’s white shoulder as she ran?
Lo, that music faint and mocking,
Is it not a pipe of Pan?
 
Hear you that elusive laughter
Of the hidden waterfall?
Nay, a satyr speeding after
Ivy-crowned bacchanal.
 
Far and farther as we wander
Sweeter shall our roaming be,
Come, for dim and winsome yonder
Lies the path to Arcady!",https://www.poeticous.com/lucy-maud-montgomery/the-forest-path
Holy Sonnet II by John Donne,John Donne,"'Holy Sonnet II' by John Donne describes one speaker's concern that he won't be able to return to God's good graces. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing how devoted he is to God and describing how he feels that God made him in his image. The speaker is dedicated to God, but he's lived a sinful life. This is something he's well aware of and which he's trying to atone for. But, he worries that he doesn't have enough time to escape Satan's grasp.","As due by many titles I resign
Myself to thee, O God. First I was made
By Thee; and for Thee, and when I was decay’d
Thy blood bought that, the which before was Thine.
I am Thy son, made with Thyself to shine,
Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid,
Thy sheep, Thine image, and—till I betray’d
Myself—a temple of Thy Spirit divine.
Why doth the devil then usurp on me?
Why doth he steal, nay ravish, that’s Thy right?
Except Thou rise and for Thine own work fight,
O! I shall soon despair, when I shall see
That Thou lovest mankind well, yet wilt not choose me,
And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me.",https://poets.org/poem/due-many-titles-i-resign-holy-sonnet-ii
"Indeed, Indeed I Cannot Tell by Henry David Thoreau",Henry David Thoreau,"In this poem, ‘Indeed, Indeed I cannot Tell,’ Henry David Thoreau manages to relate with almost every living human being. He communicates a feeling that is all too familiar for many people. He is confused about the feeling he is experiencing- so confused, in fact, that he doesn’t know whether it is love or hate. The feeling that Thoreau relates to this poem is one that most have felt when they have experienced the breaking off of a relationship. Thoreau expresses these feelings so articulately that readers can easily conclude the cause of this feeling.","Indeed indeed, I cannot tell,
Though I ponder on it well,
Which were easier to state,
All my love or all my hate.
Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me
When I say thou dost disgust me.
O, I hate thee with a hate
That would fain annihilate;
Yet sometimes against my will,
My dear friend, I love thee still.
It were treason to our love,
And a sin to God above,
One iota to abate
Of a pure impartial hate.","https://allpoetry.com/Indeed,-Indeed-I-Cannot-Tell"
Riprap by Gary Snyder,Gary Snyder,"'Riprap' by Gary Snyder describes the order of the world that includes everything, from the words we speak to an unnoticed cobble in a creek, In this poem, Snyder compares words to “riprap” – loose rocks which a person can assemble before them. The poem draws images of nature, showing how language and words can be controlled and placed in an organized manner. Riprap is often used as a foundation for a breakwater or other structures, which is why Snyder compares it to words, which form the foundation of human language, expressions, and eventually, of society.","Lay down these words

A Lecture upon the Shadow by John Donne,John Donne,"This poem is part of Songs and Sonnets, a collection of poems published two years after John Donne’s death. Songs and Sonnets includes 55 poems, which are not strictly “songs” or “sonnets”, that were not conceived as a compilation including ‘A Lecture upon the Shadow.’ They were written between 1590 and 1617 and later edited and grouped in different editions of Donne’s Poems. Consequently, the poems are all part of a love lyric but don’t always portray a single approach to love. Songs and Sonnets also includes poems like The Flea, The Good Morrow, and The Sun Rising, among others.

The poem narrates how a relationship that appeared to be blossoming has later deteriorated. Thus, love is one of the main themes of A Lecture upon the Shadow. John Donne is known for portraying intense emotions through conceits. A conceit is a metaphor that compares two dissimilar things in an unusual way. Particularly, in A Lecture upon the Shadow, the lyrical voice compares the different stages of a relationship to the course of a day and the movement of the sun.

A Lecture upon the Shadow follows the sonnet form loosely. The traditional sonnet is formed by an octave and a sestet with an ABBAABBA CDDCEE (or CDCDEE) rhyme scheme. The Shakespearean sonnet, which is contemporary to Donne’s poetry, is formed by three quatrains and a couplet in iambic pentameter with ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme. A Lecture upon the Shadow has 26 lines in iambic pentameter with an AABBCDDCEEE rhyme scheme. The varying couplets and their rhyme resemble those of Shakespeare’s poetry. Moreover, the poem uses a great number of poetic devices such as alliteration, assonance, and extended metaphors.","Stand still, and I will read to thee
A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.
These three hours that we have spent,
Walking here, two shadows went
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.
But, now the sun is just above our head,
We do those shadows tread,
And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadows, flow
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.
Except our loves at this noon stay,
We shall new shadows make the other way.
As the first were made to blind
Others, these which come behind
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,
To me thou, falsely, thine,
And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
The morning shadows wear away,
But these grow longer all the day;
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.
Love is a growing, or full constant light,
And his first minute, after noon, is night.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44118/a-lecture-upon-the-shadow
High Flight by John Gillespie Magee,John Gillespie Magee,"High Flight' by John Gillespie Magee is a moving depiction of what it is like to leave the earth and one's everyday life behind and fly. The bulk of 'High Flight' is spent depicting, through techniques such as alliteration, sibilance, and personification, the experience of flying. The speaker's descriptions are joyous and upliftings. He describes the sensations of being separated from the earth and in parts of the sky even birds don't enter into. The experience is all in all, a spiritual one that brings him closer to God.","Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds,—and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air ....

Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor ever eagle flew—
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/157986/high-flight-627d3cfb1e9b7
MCMXIV by Philip Larkin,Philip Larkin,"MCMXIV' by Philip Larkin is a war poem that focuses on the changes that came over England after the end of WWI. The poem begins with the poet focusing on a picture. Within it are men who have just signed up to fight in the war. Their faces make it clear that they have no idea what is about to happen to them. The narrative zooms out, taking the reader across the countryside and then to all of England. There are going to be so many changes in the coming years, the speaker says, everything is going to be different, and innocence is going to be lost.","Those long uneven lines
Standing as patiently
As if they were stretched outside
The Oval or Villa Park,
The crowns of hats, the sun
On moustached archaic faces
Grinning as if it were all
An August Bank Holiday lark;

And the shut shops, the bleached
Established names on the sunblinds,
The farthings and sovereigns,
And dark-clothed children at play
Called after kings and queens,
The tin advertisements
For cocoa and twist, and the pubs
Wide open all day;

And the countryside not caring:
The place-names all hazed over
With flowering grasses, and fields
Shadowing Domesday lines
Under wheat’s restless silence;
The differently-dressed servants
With tiny rooms in huge houses,
The dust behind limousines;

Never such innocence,
Never before or since,
As changed itself to past
Without a word – the men
Leaving the gardens tidy,
The thousands of marriages,
Lasting a little while longer:
Never such innocence again.",https://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/mcmxiv/
Swan in Falling Snow by Denise Levertov,Denise Levertov,"'Swan in Falling Snow' by Denise Levertov contains a description of a dead swan's body buried in the snow. Levertov's speaker talks about how he came across a swan's frozen body in the snow. The “barrel-sized” body of the creature easily captured his attention. He went near it to have a closer look. The scene made him feel sad for the creature. At the same time, it somehow aroused a sensation of awe in his heart. There was a resemblance between the frozen body and the untrodden snow near the shore. With close attention, he could notice its physical features clearly. In contrast to the stillness of the creature, nature went on at its own pace.","Swan in Falling Snow

There seemed to lie a barrel-sized, heart-shaped snowball,
Frozen hard, its white
identical with the untrodden white
of the lake shore. Closer, its somber face—
Mask and beak—came clear, the neck’s
Long cylinder, and the splayed feet, balanced,
Weary, immodbile. Black water traced, behind it,
An abandoned gesture. Soft in still air, snowflakes
Fell and fell. Silence
Deepened, deepened. The short day
Suspended itself, endless.",https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/swan-in-falling-snow-by-denise-levertov/
Mid-Term Break by Seamus Heaney,Seamus Heaney,"'Mid-Term Break' by Seamus Heaney describes the emotional turmoil experienced by a speaker who has lost a loved one in a traumatic way. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is being quarantined within a “sick bay” of his college. It is here he waited for his neighbours to come and pick him up and take him home. The boy has suffered a loss, one which does not become clear until the final line of the poem. He travels home and is met by his suffering family. His father is crying, and his mother is unable to even speak. There are many strangers around attempting to sympathize with the family, but their efforts appear awkward and are often unwanted. The body arrives via ambulance the next day and the boy takes a look at it when he is alone one morning. There are no great injuries that he can see but he knows this is due to the fact that this person was thrown by the bumper of a car. The final line states that the coffin will only be four feet long, the same length as the child's age, making clear to the reader that the speaker has lost his young brother in a terrible accident.","I sat all morning in the college sick bay
Counting bells knelling classes to a close.
At two o'clock our neighbours drove me home.

In the porch I met my father crying—
He had always taken funerals in his stride—
And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.

The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram
When I came in, and I was embarrassed
By old men standing up to shake my hand

And tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble'.
Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,
Away at school, as my mother held my hand

In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.
At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived
With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.

Next morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops
And candles soothed the bedside; I saw him
For the first time in six weeks. Paler now,

Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,
He lay in the four-foot box as in his cot.
No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.

A four-foot box, a foot for every year.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57041/mid-term-break
Aiken Drum,A List of Popular Nursery Rhymes,"'Aiken Drum' is an entertaining Scottish folksong. It describes Aiken Drum, a man whose clothes are made out of different foods. The poem starts with the speaker noting that Drum lives on the moon. He goes on to depict his clothes as made out of everything from haggis to penny loaves, roast beef, and crust pies. The speaker also notes that Aiken plays a ladle. All of this is described through a great deal of repetition with parallelism being used throughout.","There was a man lived in the moon, lived in the moon, lived in the moon,

There was a man lived in the moon,

Then by Roddy Lumsden,Roddy Lumsden,"In this piece, the speaker is listening to a lost recording of him and his lover making love. While listening to the tape, he clearly values his lover and pays specific attention to any utterances that she makes. The things that he does or says carries little importance to him. The focus is placed on her and the way she expressed herself during their union. He listens to the entire tape, even the seemingly insignificant parts which shows how much delights in the flashback. He draws attention to the slightest details including the sounds the cars made as the drove by on the way home.","For the first time, I listen to a lost
and secret recording of us
making love near-on ten years ago.

I recognize your voice, your sounds,
though if I knew no better,
I could be any man in any room.

After, the rising sounds of rising
and of dressing and once
as you step up close to the deck,

perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing
the chorus of Sunday Morning.
I call on you to hurry and we leave.

It does not end then; the tape rolls on.
A few late cars which sigh by
might have passed us walking away

triumphant, unaware we’ve left behind
this mop and mow mechanism
of silence to which we may never return.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/51033/then-56d22e83b16c1
Wild Geese by Mary Oliver,Mary Oliver,"In short, 'Wild Geese' is a poem, written by Mary Oliver, that expresses what one must do in order to lead a good life. The speaker, presumably Oliver, is talking directly to her reader, imploring them to not worry so much about being good; rather, the reader should be true to nature and the beauty found in it. Throughout the poem, Oliver uses the word “you” to speak to the reader, which lends an intimate, almost urgent air about the work. Throughout, she uses the image of a flock of wild geese. ","You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.",http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_wildgeese.html
"Father’s Day, 21 June 1992 by Paul Durcan",Paul Durcan,"'Father's Day, 21 June 1992' by Paul Durcan is a simple poem that speaks on the rocky relationship between a married couple. The poem takes the reader into the troubled marriage between a man and a woman. The man is about to leave for Cork when his wife asks him to carry an axe on the train with him. This tool should be delivered to her sister. He has no desire to take the axe with him and thinks the request is absurd, but he does give in. As he rides, passengers move away from him and he's left to consider the state of his marriage and what is left for them after the green fields have left them behind.","Just as I was dashing to catch the Dublin- Cork train
Dashing up and down the stairs, searching my pockets,
She told me that her sister in Cork wanted a loan of the axe;
It was late June and
The buddleia tree in the backyard
Had grown out of control.
The taxi was ticking over outside in the street,
All the neighbours noticing it.
‘You mean that you want me to bring her down the axe?’
‘Yes, if you wouldn’t mind, that is –‘
‘A simple saw would do the job, surely to God
She could borrow a simple saw.’
‘She said she’d like the axe.’
‘OK.’ There is a Blue Cabs taxi ticking over outside
And the whole world inspecting it,
‘I’ll bring her down the axe.’
The axe – all four-and-a-half feet of it –
Was leaning up against the wall behind the settee –
The fold-up settee that doubles as a bed.
She handed the axe to me just as it was,
As neat as a newborn babe,
All in the bare buff.
You’d think she’d have swaddled it up
In something – if not a blanket, an old newspaper,
But no, not even a token hanky",https://aoifesnotes.com/leaving-cert/ordinary-level/Paper-Two/docs/prescribed-poetry/Durcan%20-%20%20Highlighted%20Quotes%20-%20Father%92s%20Day.pdf
Another Reluctance by Annie Finch,Annie Finch,"'Another Reluctance' by Annie Finch is a thoughtful poem about an experience with chestnuts during a speaker's youth. The first lines describe the chestnuts falling and sitting among the golden leaves on a fall day. This is something the speaker has been waiting a long time for, but, as it turns out, it's still impossible to get to them. The “cases” won't open, and the speaker and other children find themselves disappointed. They try and stay and wait, and eventually, the speaker is the only one there when everyone else has gone home. They're reluctant to leave, holding out hope that something is going to change despite the fact that the fall is over and winter is setting in.","Chestnuts fell in the charred season,
Fell finally, finding room
In air to open their old cases
So they gleam out from the gold leaves,
In the dusk now, where they dropped down.

I go watch them, waiting for winter,
Their husks open and holding on.
Those rusted rims are rigid=hard
And cling clean to the clear brown,

And the fall sun sinks soon,
And the day draws to its dark end,
.and the feet give up the gray walk,
no longer lingering, light gone,
and I am here and do not go home.

Hollow gifts to cold children:
The chestnuts they hid in small caches
Have gone hollow, their gleam gone,
Their grain gone, and the children are home.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53067/another-reluctance
Remembering Fireworks by Elizabeth Jennings,Elizabeth Jennings,"Language and Imagery When it comes to the use of language and imagery, there are several types of images and vocabulary that the poet uses to describe the human feelings. Reading through the poem, you will come across images connected with fireworks, such as: “shapes”, “stars”, “diamonds”, and “rockets”. In addition, the poet also uses enjambment so that a quick pace and fast rhythm can be created in the poem. The poet makes use of this poetic device taking into account the theme of fireworks and its deeper meaning of euphoria and temporary excitement and. Moreover, the poet has cleverly used the word “falling” at the end of the fifth and second last lines, “of fire” and “stars”. The use of both these words in the poem indicates the physical act of falling. In fact, they are paradoxical, as fire and stars usually don't come down rather by nature they rise. Thus, all through the poem, you will poet making very clever use of language techniques to take ahead its theme.","Always as if for the first time, we watch
the fireworks as if no-one had ever
done this before, made shapes, signs
cut diamonds on air, sent up stars
nameless, imperious. And in the falling
of fire, the spent rocket, there is a kind
of nostalgia, as normally only attaches
to things long known and lost. Such an absence
such emptiness of sky the fireworks leave
after their festival. We, fumbling
for words of love, remember the rockets
the spinning wheels, the sudden diamonds
and say with delight “Yes, like that, like that”
Oh and the air is full of falling
stars surrendered. We search for a sign.",https://www.kidsworldfun.com/learn-english/poem-remembering-fireworks.php
I Hear America Singing by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"Poetic Form Walt Whitman was an experimental poet, toying with forms of poetry. He is also known as the father of free verse poetry. He deemed himself above rigors of rhyme and meter since Whitman used free verses freely. However, his poetry is not a bunch of non-rhyming lines as 'I Hear America Singing' is a decent, tightly moderated poem. The poem is a listing of manual workers, their work content, and singing along the way. The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beamThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off workThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deck-hand singing on the steamboat deck As is the case, Walt Whitman's poems tend to get lengthy as they progress, whereas they are tightly managed in the beginning. This phenomenon is called anaphora as repetition keeps recurring. It is the polar opposite of traditional poetry norms where verses are controlled tightly in order to maintain the rhyming sequence. In the case of Walt Whitman, he aspired to seek freedom of self-exploration and discovery, rising above conventional forms like a true American.","I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,
The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/walt-whitman
Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape by John Ashbery,John Ashbery,"'Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape' by John Ashbery is an unusual poem that uses the cartoon characters from Popeye to speak about American, middle-class dissatisfaction. The poem is a strange one. It follows a few moments in the lives of recognizable characters from the Popeye cartoon included Olive, Sea Hag, Whimpy, and Swee'pea. The characters are staying in Popeye's apartment and go through emotional ups and downs. At one point, they feel like they're on a vacation, and in the next, they're irritated with the city and want to go to the country. When Olive comes into the poem and declares that Popeye has been exiled to the country and also describes his ability to control lightning, the poem gets more complex. In the end, after going back and forth in regards to how happy or unhappy they are, Popeye sends thunder into the apartment that's “domestic” and green like spinach.","The first of the undecoded messages read: “Popeye sits in thunder, Unthought of. From that shoebox of an apartment,
From livid curtain’s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.”
Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: “How pleasant To spend one’s vacation en la casa de Popeye,” she scratched
Her cleft chin’s solitary hair. She remembered spinach
And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach. “M’love,” he intercepted, “the plains are decked out in thunder Today, and it shall be as you wish.” He scratched
The part of his head under his hat. The apartment
Seemed to grow smaller. “But what if no pleasant
Inspiration plunge us now to the stars? For this is my country.”
Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country. Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach When the door opened and Swee’pea crept in. “How pleasant!”
But Swee’pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. “Thunder And tears are unavailing,” it read. “Henceforth shall Popeye’s apartment Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.”
Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched
Her long thigh. “I have news!” she gasped. “Popeye, forced as you know to flee the country
One musty gusty evening, by the schemes of his wizened, duplicate father, jealous of the apartment
And all that it contains, myself and spinach
In particular, heaves bolts of loving thunder
At his own astonished becoming, rupturing the pleasant
Arpeggio of our years. No more shall pleasant
Rays of the sun refresh your sense of growing old, nor the scratched Tree-trunks and mossy foliage, only immaculate darkness and thunder.” She grabbed Swee’pea. “I’m taking the brat to the country.”
“But you can’t do that—he hasn’t even finished his spinach,” Urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment.
But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment
Succumbed to a strange new hush. “Actually it’s quite pleasant
Here,” thought the Sea Hag. “If this is all we need fear from spinach
Then I don’t mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over”—she scratched
One dug pensively—“but Wimpy is such a country
Bumpkin, always burping like that.” Minute at first, the thunder
Soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder, The color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched
His balls: it sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47763/farm-implements-and-rutabagas-in-a-landscape
"I Remember, I Remember by Philip Larkin",Philip Larkin,"I Remember, I Remember' by Philip Larkin contains the passing thoughts of a speaker as he sees his hometown of Coventry from a train. The poem begins with the speaker and his friend arriving, briefly, in Coventry. They are on their way somewhere else and are stopped at the platform. The speaker looks around, hoping to see something he recognizes, but doesn't. This fact does not surprise him as Coventry was never really a home to him. The rest of the poem is devoted to describing things that didn't happen to the speaker. He has in his mind an idealized version of what childhood should be. He also knows his childhood did not match up with his own experience. The speaker did not have close family friends, spend happy hours in the garden, or have his written work recognized by someone of marginal importance. These factors add up to an unhappy childhood that the speaker's friend questions him about. The poem concludes with the speaker saying it wasn't Coventry's fault he was unhappy as he would've been unhappy anywhere.","Coming up England by a different line
For once, early in the cold new year,
We stopped, and, watching men with number plates
Sprint down the platform to familiar gates,
""Why, Coventry!"" I exclaimed. ""I was born here.""

I leant far out, and squinnied for a sign
That this was still the town that had been 'mine'
So long, but found I wasn't even clear
Which side was which. From where those cycle-crates
Were standing, had we annually departed

For all those family hols? . . . A whistle went:
Things moved. I sat back, staring at my boots.
'Was that,' my friend smiled, 'where you ""have your roots""?'
No, only where my childhood was unspent,
I wanted to retort, just where I started:

By now I've got the whole place clearly charted.
Our garden, first: where I did not invent
Blinding theologies of flowers and fruits,
And wasn't spoken to by an old hat.
And here we have that splendid family

I never ran to when I got depressed,
The boys all biceps and the girls all chest,
Their comic Ford, their farm where I could be
'Really myself'. I'll show you, come to that,
The bracken where I never trembling sat,

Determined to go through with it; where she
Lay back, and 'all became a burning mist'.
And, in those offices, my doggerel
Was not set up in blunt ten-point, nor read
By a distinguished cousin of the mayor,

Who didn't call and tell my father There
Before us, had we the gift to see ahead -
'You look as though you wished the place in Hell,'
My friend said, 'judging from your face.' 'Oh well,
I suppose it's not the place's fault,' I said.

To an Early Daffodil by Amy Lowell,Amy Lowell,"'To an Early Daffodil' by Amy Lowell is a lovely poem in which the speaker talks to a daffodil and describes its best features. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker describes the transition from spring to summer through the sun's increased heat. This comes down to the earth and the soil and makes the daffodil bloom. This is encouraged further by some rainstorms. When the daffodil does bloom, it is gold like the sun and standing erect through the season. There's nothing that can diminish its beauty.","Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring!
Thou herald of rich Summer's myriad flowers!
The climbing sun with new recovered powers
Does warm thee into being, through the ring
Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling
Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers
Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers,
Till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing
To make all nature glad, thou art so gay;
To fill the lonely with a joy untold;
Nodding at every gust of wind to-day,
To-morrow jewelled with raindrops. Always bold
To stand erect, full in the dazzling play
Of April's sun, for thou hast caught his gold.",https://poets.org/poem/early-daffodil
To the Indifferent Women by Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman,Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman,"To the Indifferent Women is addressed to the “indifferent women” who sit idly in their homes, only concerned with those that are directly, physically, near to them. The speaker of the poem spends these seven stanzas chastising the women for their selfishness and inability to care about the entire world. They cannot see outside of their own home. She calls upon their motherhood to spread to those that are desperate for food and a mother's love. To the Indifferent Women concludes with the statement that if men and women could come together and share their love with the whole world, all homes would be happy. She is promoting the idea that we must allow ourselves to look out from our own worlds and into those that are uncomfortable and even miserable. If we do not allow ourselves to see the world in its entirety, we may not be able to hold onto the happiness that we have created for ourselves. Those that are lucky, must help those that are not.","You who are happy in a thousand homes,
Or overworked therein, to a dumb peace;
Whose souls are wholly centered in the life
Of that small group you personally love;
Who told you that you need not know or care
About the sin and sorrow of the world?

Do you believe the sorrow of the world
Does not concern you in your little homes? —
That you are licensed to avoid the care
And toil for human progress, human peace,
And the enlargement of our power of love
Until it covers every field of life?

The one first duty of all human life
Is to promote the progress of the world
In righteousness, in wisdom, truth and love;
And you ignore it, hidden in your homes,
Content to keep them in uncertain peace,
Content to leave all else without your care.

Yet you are mothers! And a mother's care
Is the first step toward friendly human life.
Life where all nations in untroubled peace
Unite to raise the standard of the world
And make the happiness we seek in homes
Spread everywhere in strong and fruitful love.

You are content to keep that mighty love
In its first steps forever; the crude care
Of animals for mate and young and homes,
Instead of pouring it abroad in life,
Its mighty current feeding all the world
Till every human child can grow in peace.

You cannot keep your small domestic peace
Your little pool of undeveloped love,
While the neglected, starved, unmothered world
Struggles and fights for lack of mother's care,
And its tempestuous, bitter, broken life
Beats in upon you in your selfish homes.

We all may have our homes in joy and peace
When woman's life, in its rich power of love
Is joined with man's to care for all the world.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46059/to-the-indifferent-women
To be of use by Marge Piercy,Marge Piercy,"'To be of use' by Marge Piercy depicts one speaker's preference to be around those who work hard and understand the importance of perseverance. The poem takes the reader through metaphorical comparisons between oxen, water buffalo, and seals. Each has their own skill and confidence in their individual environments. The speaker says she is interested in people who embody these same traits. She goes on, referencing the pleasures and payoffs of hard work and connecting them to a Hopi vase and Greek amphora. Just as these creations cry out for work, so too do human beings.","The people I love the best
jump into work head first
without dallying in the shallows
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.
They seem to become natives of that element,
the black sleek heads of seals
bouncing like half-submerged balls.
I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,
who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,
who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,
who do what has to be done, again and again.
I want to be with people who submerge
in the task, who go into the fields to harvest
and work in a row and pass the bags along,
who are not parlor generals and field deserters
but move in a common rhythm
when the food must come in or the fire be put out.
The work of the world is common as mud.
Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.
But the thing worth doing well done
has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.
Greek amphoras for wine or oil,
Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums
but you know they were made to be used.
The pitcher cries for water to carry
and a person for work that is real.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57673/to-be-of-use
Tissue by Imtiaz Dharker,Imtiaz Dharker,"‘Tissue’ by Imtiaz Dharker uses the metaphor of paper to speak about the impermanence of humanity. In the first lines, the poet draws attention to the significance of paper in various contexts. The back pages of a well-used book or the pages of the Koran, where names and histories are recorded, represent the accumulation of human stories and experiences. The poet highlights the nature of buildings by suggesting that if they were made of paper, they would easily crumble and disappear with a sigh or a shift of wind. The poem also suggests that an architect could utilize the transformative power of paper and light, creating layers of meaning and beauty in a structure. Rather than relying on durable materials like brick or block, the poet envisions a structure made of paper, representing the fragile nature of existence.","Paper that lets the light
shine through, this
is what could alter things.
Paper thinned by age or touching,
the kind you find in well-used books,
the back of the Koran, where a hand
has written in the names and histories,
who was born to whom,
the height and weight, who
died where and how, on which sepia date,
pages smoothed and stroked and turned
transparent with attention.
If buildings were paper, I might
feel their drift, see how easily
they fall away on a sigh, a shift
in the direction of the wind.
Maps too. The sun shines through
their borderlines, the marks
that rivers make, roads,
railtracks, mountainfolds,
Fine slips from grocery shops
that say how much was sold
and what was paid by credit card
might fly our lives like paper kites.
An architect could use all this,
place layer over layer, luminous
script over numbers over line,
and never wish to build again with brick
or block, but let the daylight break
through capitals and monoliths,
through the shapes that pride can make,
find a way to trace a grand design
with living tissue, raise a structure
never meant to last,
of paper smoothed and stroked
and thinned to be transparent,
turned into your skin.",https://genius.com/Imtiaz-dharker-tissue-annotated
may we raise children who love the unloved things by Nicolette Sowder,Nicolette Sowder,"'may we raise children who love the unloved things' by Nicolette Sowder is a poem written in advice, asking parents to raise their children to be kind. Overall else, Sowder implores that children be raised to 'love the unloved things'. The 'unloved things' in this context represent all of the objects, ideas, or people that don't get a say, or aren't traditionally valued or important. The poet values kindness above all else.","May we raise children

worms & spiderlings.
Children who sense
the rose needs the thorn
& run into rainswept days

who have no voice

wilder bond, those days of
tending tender things

A Nation’s Strength by William Ralph Emerson,William Ralph Emerson,'A Nation's Strength' by William Ralph Emerson is a straightforward poem about the strength of countries and where it comes from. This poem begins with the speaker presenting readers with rhetorical questions regarding where a nation's strength comes from. He then goes on to pose a few different answers before coming to the conclusion that strength comes from leaders who work harder than everyone else and are capable of inspiring those around them.,"What makes a nation's pillars high
And its foundations strong?
What makes it mighty to defy
The foes that round it throng?

It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand
Go down in battle shock;
Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,
Not on abiding rock.

Is it the sword? Ask the red dust
Of empires passed away;
The blood has turned their stones to rust,
Their glory to decay.

And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown
Has seemed to nations sweet;
But God has struck its luster down
In ashes at his feet.

Not gold but only men can make
A people great and strong;
Men who for truth and honor's sake
Stand fast and suffer long.

Brave men who work while others sleep,
Who dare while others fly...
They build a nation's pillars deep
And lift them to the sky.",https://poets.org/poem/nations-strength
Eating Together by Li-Young Lee,Li-Young Lee,"'Eating Together' by Li-Young Lee is a simple yet effective poem about the loss a family suffered and the time they spend together. In the first lines of 'Eating Together,' the speaker begins by describing what his family is going to have to eat. These lines are a stark contrast with the final four, in which the poet is far more lyrical and emotional. Between these sections, the speaker notes that he's there with his mother, brothers, and sister. Together, they're sitting down for a meal that includes trout, ginger, and more. His mother has a new role at the table, he says. She tastes the “sweetest meat of the head,” as his father used to do. With this line, it becomes clear that the family has suffered a loss. The final four lines, or quatrain, describe the father through a simile. He's compared to a snow-covered road that has no travelers and is lonely for none. He went to sleep, likely a euphemism for dying, and now the family dynamic has changed. But, they are still together, and life goes on.","In the steamer is the trout seasoned with slivers of ginger,
two sprigs of green onion, and sesame oil. We shall eat it with rice for lunch, brothers, sister, my mother who will taste the sweetest meat of the head, holding it between her fingers deftly, the way my father did weeks ago. Then he lay down to sleep like a snow-covered road winding through pines older than him, without any travelers, and lonely for no one.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43015/eating-together-56d221af2bf26
Quai de la Tournelle by John Dos Passos,John Dos Passos,"Quai de la Tournelle' by John Dos Passos is a poem about a lost love and how the sights and sounds of the Seine River in Paris bring that love to mind. The poem begins with the narrator looking out at the Seine River and describing the conflict he feels as it “swirl[s] away.” He describes it as being both “dark” and as “Laughing,” setting up the backdrop for the tumult of emotions that he will expound on. In an attempt to escape from the powerful emotions that hearing and seeing the river unearth, the speaker flees into his home. Bolting the door behind him, he ascends to his room where he hopes to find silence. Instead, an open window lets the sounds of the river into his room. It is at this point in the poem that the reader will come to understand that the narrator has lost a love of the utmost importance to him. He feels this loss intensely and is further reminded of it on the bank of the river. Additionally, as he looks below him to the street, it seems as if every passerby is in possession of a lilac flower (symbolizing love and youthful innocence, two things he has lost). The smell of the flowers has a similar impact on the speaker as the sound of the river. The poem concludes with the narrator relating his loss of love to the formation and dissipation of the smell of flowers and the rapidly running river. ","I
In the dark the river spins,
Laughs and ripples never ceasing,
Swells to gurgle under arches,
Swishes past the hows of barges.
In its haste to swirl away
From the stone walls of the city
That has lamps that weight the eddies
Down with snaky silver glitter.
As it flies it calls me with it
Through the meadows to the sea.

I close the door on it, draw the bolts,
Climb the stairs to my silent room;
But through the window that swings open
Comes again its shuttle-song,
Spinning love and night and madness,
Madness of the spring at sea.

II
The streets are full of lilacs.
Lilacs in boys' buttonholes,
Lilacs at women's waists;
Arms full of lilacs, people trail behind them through the moist night
Long swirls of fragrance.
Fragrance of gardens,
Fragrance of hedgerows where they have wandered
All the May day,
Where the lovers have held each other's hands
And lavished vermilion kisses
Under the portent of the swaying plumes
Of the funereal lilacs.

The streets are full of lilacs
That trail long swirls and eddies of fragrance,
Arabesques of fragrance,
Like the arabesques that form and fade,
In the fleeting ripples of the jade-green river.",https://poets.org/poem/quai-de-la-tournelle
Wilderness by Carl Sandburg,Carl Sandburg,"“Wilderness” by Carl Sandburg describes the animalistic, spiritual life forces that reside inside one man's body and the abilities he gained from them. The poem begins with the speaker describing how he is made up of a number of different animals. They are so integral to his being it is like they are inside him. He begins by speaking about the “blood-red” wolf who gives him undeniable strength. He then moves onto the “silver-grey fox” who is both cunning and vicious. The next stanzas speak of his ability to keep a “hog” and an extremely unattractive baboon inside of him. These creatures are not obvious in their benefits but the speaker makes clear why they matter to him. The final animals are the most interesting. He contains the first fish-like creature to ever walk on the planet, a sign of his spiritually important pedigree. Lastly, he has a dichotomy of birds. The final section speaks on the narrator's dedication to maintaining his interior zoo as well as all that which makes him a lover, mother and father. He is a part of the world and will take care of all that which he contributes to it.","There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of blood—I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go. There is a fox in me . . . a silver-gray fox . . . I sniff and guess . . . I pick things out of the wind and air . . . I nose in the dark night and take sleepers and eat them and hide the feathers . . . I circle and loop and double-cross.
There is a hog in me . . . a snout and a belly . . . a machinery for eating and grunting . . . a machinery for sleeping satisfied in the sun—I got this too from the wilderness and the wilderness will not let it go.
There is a fish in me . . . I know I came from salt-blue water-gates . . . I scurried with shoals of herring . . . I blew waterspouts with porpoises . . . before land was . . . before the water went down . . . before Noah . . . before the first chapter of Genesis.
There is a baboon in me . . . clambering-clawed . . . dog-faced . . . yawping a galoot’s hunger . . . hairy under the armpits . . . here are the hawk-eyed hankering men . . . here are the blonde and blue-eyed women . . . here they hide curled asleep waiting . . . ready to snarl and kill . . . ready to sing and give milk . . . waiting—I keep the baboon because the wilderness says so.
There is an eagle in me and a mockingbird . . . and the eagle flies among the Rocky Mountains of my dreams and fights among the Sierra crags of what I want . . . and the mockingbird warbles in the early forenoon before the dew is gone, warbles in the underbrush of my Chattanoogas of hope, gushes over the blue Ozark foothills of my wishes—And I got the eagle and the mockingbird from the wilderness.
O, I got a zoo, I got a menagerie, inside my ribs, under my bony head, under my red-valve heart—and I got something else: it is a man-child heart, a woman-child heart: it is a father and mother and lover: it came from God-Knows-Where: it is going to God-Knows-Where—For I am the keeper of the zoo: I say yes and no: I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world: I came from the wilderness.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53233/wilderness
I’ll Open the Window by Anna Swir,Anna Swir,"This poem, which you can read here, speaks honestly and freely about the speaker's failed relationship. This piece reflects a story of a woman whose lengthy relationship has exposed her own vices as well as her partner's for too long of a time. Because of this, she frees herself of her significant other and goes on a journey for freedom. During this poem, one is reminded of the beauties of being alone. The author reaffirms her need for solidarity in the final stanza. Without hesitation, the speaker goes full force into a life of new meaning. She undergoes a process of finding herself again. As her mind is freed, she is able to become in tune with the needs and happenings that are present in the world.","Our embrace lasted too long.
We loved right down to the bone.
I hear the bones grind, I see
our two skeletons.
Now I am waiting
till you leave, till
the clatter of your shoes
is heard no more. Now, silence.
Tonight I am going to sleep alone
on the bedclothes of purity.
Aloneness
is the first hygienic measure.
Aloneness
will enlarge the walls of the room,
I will open the window
and the large, frosty air will enter,
healthy as tragedy.
Human thoughts will enter
and human concerns,
misfortune of others, saintliness of others.
They will converse softly and sternly.
Do not come anymore.
I am an animal

Stolen Rivers by Phillippa Yaa de Villiers,Phillippa Yaa de Villiers,"Stolen Rivers Analysis The very first line of the poem, which can be read in full here, and the use of first-person “We” themselves suggest that the poet and to whom (Chiwoniso) this poem is dedicated both came to Berlin from Africa to do their jobs like singing songs and reciting poetry. The “We” also represents the whole African community, who shift to different parts of the world to earn their livelihood. Since, with “We” she is representing the whole community of Africans; this first-person pronoun can be understood as a representative of all those Africans who live in different parts of the world. The poet further says that they both had the same agenda, that is; singing and reciting poems. But how can they both forget their anthems of loss, like galloping, consuming, the pillage, the cries, like forest fires, like haunted children that they had to face due to racism, how can they forget the loss they had to bear due to racism, and how can they redress the loss caused by this apartheid—a system of segregation or discrimination on the grounds of race in South Africa. In further lines, when the poet says: “Enraged, we wanted revenge”, it means that not only they both (Chiwoniso and Phillippa Yaa De Villiers) were enraged at what they had to face for being black in colour, but they too experienced a great loss of their properties and personal belongings. However, when, the poet says, Chiwoniso stepped on the stage and opened her mouth that is; started singing beautiful songs with great and revolutionary lyrics, the people of Africa were highly impressed and inspired. Every stolen river of platinum and gold poured out of your mouth in song was like an inspiring and revolutionary message for all Africans living in different parts of the world. The poet says that your voice (Chiwoniso's voice) not only brought them out of the night or the darkness of discrimination and racism, but it also doubled the light in each of them, that is, all the Africans became more enlightened and aware of their rights. The poet says that from Benin to Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe to Cairo all got mesmerized, enthralled, and impressed by Chiwoniso's singing, they were restored with all the treasure-houses. With the presence of Chiwoniso, Africa not only moved its golden bones, but it also broke free from its heavy chains or shackles of racism. As Chiwoniso came into their lives with her singing, Africa also started dancing again. The last lines of the poem are very poignant, and they really touch hearts when the poet says: “love could purchase bread, Africans would not be hungry,” which shows that on the night when the poet was writing this poem, she was very sad, and feeling dejected to the rampant racism, remembering the past loss she had to bear. Through the last two lines, the poet also gives the message, by saying if the whites had love, respect in their hearts, and had not discriminated against them on the basis of their colours, neither the Africans had to stay hungry, nor they had to experience the loss, caused by racial discrimination. That night could either be the night when the poet wrote this poem, or this night could also be the night when the great soul of Africa, Chiwoniso Maraire died. Thus, the poem, Stolen River, is a masterpiece by Phillippa Yaa De Villiers, who was a well-known writer at her own age.","We Africans came to Berlin to sing
and recite poetry. We had an agenda:
remembering our anthems of loss,
galloping, consuming,
the pillage, the cries
like forest fires, like haunted children,
how can we, how can we even
begin to redress?
Enraged, we wanted revenge
and then, Chiwoniso, you stepped on the stage and
you opened your mouth and
every stolen river of platinum and gold
poured out of your mouth in song;
your voice etched us out of the night
and doubled the light in each of us.
You restored all the treasure-houses
from Benin to Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe to Cairo;
Africa moved its golden bones,
shook off its heavy chains
and danced again.
That night I thought
if only
love could purchase bread,
Africans would not be hungry.",https://academichelp.net/samples/academics/reviews/poetry-analysis/stolen-rivers.html
Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe,Edgar Allan Poe,"Edgar Allan Poe writes Annabel Lee in the most unique tone, as was one of trademarks. When the poem begins, it sounds like a fairy tale and gives the reader a feeling of all that is good and happy. But underneath this joyful tone is a tone more ominous, and Poe uses certain words and phrases that give this eerie feeling. Partway through the poem, the readers begin to understand that this is not a common fairy tale. Rather, this is a dark and terrifying story. The tones and rhythms Poe use create an almost hypnotic effect.

The poem reads like a nursery rhyme in the way that it sounds, allowing the readers to venture back into childhood days in order to relate with the speaker. However, the content of the poem is not suitable for children, and so the contrast between the rhyme and rhythm of the poem and the content leaves the reader feeling deeply moved. This is a skill Poe used in many of his works. His tone is entirely unique. He has a way of grasping the readers’ attention and pulling them into his work before he reveals the truly dark and sometimes cynical nature of the content.","It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we—
Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea—
In her tomb by the sounding sea.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44885/annabel-lee
Homework by Allen Ginsberg,Allen Ginsberg,"'Homework' by Allen Ginsberg describes how the speaker tries to wash various places on the earth clean like before. In 'Homework' by Allen Ginsberg, the speaker feels as if the dirty places are clothes. He tries to wash them clean and remove the dirt of environmental degradation, politics, and pollution. There is a reference to a variety of countries, rivers, and places in this poem. The poet refers to countries such as Iran, the United States, Alaska, Russia, and China. Moreover, the poet refers to continents such as Africa, Asia, and North America. He also talks about the rivers namely Amazon, Rhine, Hudson, Thames, and Neckar, and other water bodies such as Carin and Gulf of Mexico, Love Canal, Mediterranean basin, and Lake Eerie. Apart from that, there are other references in the poem such as the North Pole, Rocky Flats, Los Alamos, Parthenon, and Sphinx. By pointing out these places, Ginsberg highlights the major causes of natural degradation in the mentioned places. Last but not least, he wants to purify them by symbolically washing, scrubbing, wiping, rubbing, rinsing, and wringing those places.","If I were doing my Laundry I’d wash my dirty Iran
I’d throw in my United States, and pour on the Ivory Soap, scrub up Africa, put all the birds and elephants back in the jungle,
I’d wash the Amazon river and clean the oily Carib & Gulf of Mexico, Rub that smog off the North Pole, wipe up all the pipelines in Alaska, Rub a dub dub for Rocky Flats and Los Alamos, Flush that sparkly Cesium out of Love Canal
Rinse down the Acid Rain over the Parthenon & Sphinx, Drain Sludge out of the Mediterranean basin & make it azure again,
Put some blueing back into the sky over the Rhine, bleach the little Clouds so snow return white as snow,
Cleanse the Hudson Thames & Neckar, Drain the Suds out of Lake Erie Then I’d throw big Asia in one giant Load & wash out the blood & Agent Orange,
Dump the whole mess of Russia and China in the wringer, squeeze out the tattletail Gray of U.S. Central American police state,
& put the planet in the drier & let it sit 20 minutes or an Aeon till it came out clean.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49311/homework-56d22b44cb0bd
The Planners by Boey Kim Cheng,Boey Kim Cheng,"'The Planners' by Boey Kim Cheng is an effective poem about the impact of industrialization and development. The speaker spends the three stanzas of this free verse poem addressing the impact that the “planners” have on the world around him and others. He suggests that the constant desire to build a new, better city is detrimental to one's understanding of the past. At the end of the poem, the speaker discusses how as a poet, the new world that's been created around him is entirely uninspiring. His poet's heart is not going to bleed for these sites, sounds, and lack of history that surrounds him (or that he believes is going to surround him as things change in the future).","They plan. They build. All spaces are gridded,
filled with permutations of possibilities.
The buildings are in alignment with the roads
which meet at desired points
linked by bridges all hang
in the grace of mathematics.
They build and will not stop.
Even the sea draws back
and the skies surrender.
They erase the flaws,
the blemishes of the past, knock off
useless blocks with dental dexterity.
All gaps are plugged
with gleaming gold.
The country wears perfect rows of shining teeth.
Anaesthesia, amnesia, hypnosis.
They have the means.
They have it all so it will not hurt,
so history is new again.
The piling will not stop.
The drilling goes right through
the fossils of last century.
But my heart would not bleed
poetry. Not a single drop
to stain the blueprint
of our past’s tomorrow.",https://poetryprof.com/the-planners/
We Are Going by Oodgeroo Noonuccal,Oodgeroo Noonuccal,"'We Are Going' by Oodgeroo Noonuccal is a haunting poem that highlights the struggle of Aboriginal Australian tribes as they attempt to preserve their land, culture, and history. In the first part of this poem, the speaker, someone outside the Aboriginal Australian community, describes a small group, all the remains of a specific tribe, coming into town. They come to the place of their “old bora ground” and appear like strangers amongst the changes that the “many white men” have made. The poem transitions into the perspective of the small group, utilizing the word “We” at the beginning of successive lines. The group of Aboriginal Australians highlights the importance of the land, their culture, and their past. They allude to all that's been lost and the remaining strength of their community. As the poem concludes, the group of speakers also describe how British colonialism has affected the land itself and the animals that used to reside there. The poem ends with the haunting line “We are going” suggesting that soon, all remaining members of this tribe, and tribes across Australia, will be lost.","They came in to the little town
A semi-naked band subdued and silent
All that remained of their tribe.
They came here to the place of their old bora ground
Where now the many white men hurry about like ants.
Notice of the estate agent reads: 'Rubbish May Be Tipped Here'.
Now it half covers the traces of the old bora ring.
'We are as strangers here now, but the white tribe are the strangers.
We belong here, we are of the old ways.
We are the corroboree and the bora ground,
We are the old ceremonies, the laws of the elders.
We are the wonder tales of Dream Time, the tribal legends told.
We are the past, the hunts and the laughing games, the wandering camp fires.
We are the lightening bolt over Gaphembah Hill
Quick and terrible,
And the Thunderer after him, that loud fellow.
We are the quiet daybreak paling the dark lagoon.
We are the shadow-ghosts creeping back as the camp fires burn low.
We are nature and the past, all the old ways
Gone now and scattered.
The scrubs are gone, the hunting and the laughter.
The eagle is gone, the emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place.
The bora ring is gone.
The corroboree is gone.
And we are going",https://cpb-ap-se2.wpmucdn.com/learn.stleonards.vic.edu.au/dist/5/118/files/2012/09/We-Are-Going-by-Oodgeroo-Noonuccal.pdf
XII: An Epitaph by A.E. Housman,A. E. Housman,"'XII: An Epitaph' by A.E. Housman is a short poem told from the perspective of someone who knows that he's about to die. In the first lines of 'XII: An Epitaph,' the speaker talks to the listener, a visitor or passerby of some kind. This person, he says, is welcome to stay but probably shouldn't because the night is on the way. Night, it soon becomes clear, is a metaphor for death, something that's coming to claim the speaker. The speaker spends the remaining lines of the poem describing death as something he's welcoming. He doesn't mind that it's coming for him as it'll be a welcome relief to the ancient evil that has been tormenting him.","Stay, if you list, O passer by the way;
Yet night approaches; better not to stay.
I never sigh, nor flush, nor knit the brow,
Nor grieve to think how ill God made me, now.
Here, with one balm for many fevers found,
Whole of an ancient evil, I sleep sound.",https://allpoetry.com/XII:-An-Epitaph
The Owl and the Pussy-Cat by Edward Lear,Edward Lear,"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat' by Edward Lear is a simple, joy-filled poem that tells the marriage story of an owl and a cat. This nonsense poem starts with the boat journey of the two main characters named in the title. They profess their love to one another and decide to get married. They need to find a ring and their search takes them to a pig. That pig sells them its nose ring for one shilling and they get married. After that, there is much celebrating and the poem ends with the owl and pussy-cat dancing under the moon.","I
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat,
They took some honey, and plenty of money,
Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
""O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are!""
II
Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl!
How charmingly sweet you sing!
O let us be married! too long we have tarried:
But what shall we do for a ring?""
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the Bong-Tree grows
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose,
With a ring at the end of his nose.
III
""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon,
They danced by the light of the moon.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43188/the-owl-and-the-pussy-cat
The Snow-Storm by Ralph Waldo Emerson,Ralph Waldo Emerson,"'The Snow-Storm' by Ralph Waldo Emerson is a colorful and joyful depiction of a night-long snowstorm and the “art” that's revealed in the morning. The poem depicts the sudden appearance of the storm and the way in which everyone had to shelter inside. All travel was stopped and everyone turned inward to themselves and their housemates. But, outside their homes, the wind—a skilled and powerful craftsman— was working on his structures. When the sun finally came up the next morning the speaker took note of everything that had been created overnight. There were turrets and bastions, there were swan-like creations and wreaths that appeared to be made of marble. Discover more Ralph Waldo Emerson poems here.","Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,
Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,
Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,
And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit
Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed
In a tumultuous privacy of storm.
Come see the north wind's masonry.
Out of an unseen quarry evermore
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer
Curves his white bastions with projected roof
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he
For number or proportion. Mockingly,
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;
A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;
Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,
Maugre the farmer's sighs; and, at the gate,
A tapering turret overtops the work.
And when his hours are numbered, and the world
Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,
Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art
To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,
Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,
The frolic architecture of the snow.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45872/the-snow-storm-56d22594aa595
Lines Written Near San Francisco by Louis Simpson,Louis Simpson,"'Lines Written Near San Francisco' by Louis Simpson presents a lifeless description of the city that appears to the poet as “a murmur of serious life.” The poet, Simpson sets the mood of the poem from the very first stanza. In the first section, the poet refers to the opera singers who once mesmerized the people with their unique voices. Thereafter, in the next section of the poem, the poet describes how the brick-and-mortar dots the city. The city lacks the free lands where once poets like Simpson, Walt Whitman wandered and composed poems. In the last section of the poem, Simpson presents dark imagery. Here, the speaker laments the loss of innocence for the rise of harsh modernity.","I wake and feel the city trembling.
Yes, there is something unsettled in the air And the earth is uncertain.
And so it was for the tenor Caruso.
He couldn’t sleep—you know how the ovation Rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part.
And then the ceiling trembled
And the floor moved. He ran into the street. Never had Naples given him such a reception!
The air was darker than Vesuvius. “O mamma mia,”
He cried, “I’ve lost my voice!”
At that moment the hideous voice of Culture, Hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs, Shrieked from the ruins.
At that moment everyone became a performer. Otello and Don Giovanni And Figaro strode on the midmost stage.
In the high window of a burning castle Lucia raved. Black horses
Plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells.
The curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords Were melting; masks and ruffs
Burned—and the costumes of the peasants’ chorus.
Night fell. The white moon rose And sank in the Pacific. The tremors Passed under the waves. And Death rested.

Now, as we stand idle,
Watching the silent, bowler-hatted man,
The engineer, who writes in the smoking field;
Now as he hands the paper to a boy,
Who takes it and runs to a group of waiting men, And they disperse and move toward their wagons,
Mules bray and the wagons move—
Wait! Before you start
(Already the wheels are rattling on the stones)
Say, did your fathers cross the dry Sierras To build another London?
Do Americans always have to be second-rate?
Wait! For there are spirits
In the earth itself, or the air, or sea. Where are the aboriginal American devils?
Cloud shadows, pine shadows
Falling across the bright Pacific bay ... (Already they have nailed rough boards together)
Wait only for the wind
That rustles in the eucalyptus tree. Wait only for the light
That trembles on the petals of a rose.
(The mortar sets—banks are the first to stand) Wait for a rose, and you may wait forever.
The silent man mops his head and drinks Cold lemonade. “San Francisco Is a city second only to Paris.”

Every night, at the end of America
We taste our wine, looking at the Pacific. How sad it is, the end of America!
While we were waiting for the land They’d finished it—with gas drums
On the hilltops, cheap housing in the valleys
Where lives are mean and wretched. But the banks thrive and the realtors Rejoice—they have their America.
Still, there is something unsettled in the air. Out there on the Pacific There’s no America but the Marines.
Whitman was wrong about the People,
But right about himself. The land is within.
At the end of the open road we come to ourselves.
Though mad Columbus follows the sun Into the sea, we cannot follow.
We must remain, to serve the returning sun,
And to set tables for death.
For we are the colonists of Death—
Not, as some think, of the English.
And we are preparing thrones for him to sit, Poems to read, and beds In which it may please him to rest.
This is the land
The pioneers looked for, shading their eyes Against the sun—a murmur of serious life.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42823/lines-written-near-san-francisco
