Solitude by A.A. Milne,Alan Alexander Milne,"Solitude' by A.A. Milne is a very simple poem that discusses Christopher Robin's “house” where he goes to when he wants to be alone. This “house” is somewhere that no one can spend time but him. It's in a position far enough from his real home that he doesn't have to listen to anyone else talk. When he needs to get away from all the voices in his home he goes there for some peace and quiet. While there, he is in total control of his small world. The short lines of this poem are full of rhyme and rhythm and were written to be relatable to a young audience reading or hearing them read aloud.","I have a house where I go
When there's too many people,
I have a house where I go
Where no one can be;
I have a house where I go,
Where nobody ever says ""No"";
Where no one says anything- so
There is no one but me.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8518933-Solitude-by-A.A.-Milne
On My Boat on Lake Cayuga by William Cole,William Cole,"'On My Boat on Lake Cayuga' by William Cole is a short poem about a man and his boat. The speaker of this piece imagines himself on his boat sailing across the scenic Cayuga Lake. He prefers sailing on the lake rather than driving on the road. His attitude towards cars seems dismissive as he calls the people who use them “modern creep[s].” They are always in a hurry and keep honking. It annoys the speaker the most, and it gets reflected in the poem's tone. Besides, the speaker is free-spirited and prefers the openness of the lake rather than the hustle and bustle of the roads. In totality, this poem speaks about the speaker's preferences in life.","On my boat on Lake Cayuga
I have a horn that goes “Ay-oogah!”
I’m not the modern kind of creep
Who has a horn that goes “beep beep.”",https://poettreeyr.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/august-10-william-cole-on-my-boat-on-lake-cayuga/
On the Pulse of Morning by Maya Angelou,Maya Angelou,"'On the Pulse of Morning' by Maya Angelou is a poem dealing with the voices of the rock, river, and tree and how humans can make this earth a better place for everyone. This poem begins with a short depiction of the lost era when ancient creatures existed. However, with time, they lost. Now, the speaker says even nature, being the essence of life, is now on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the speaker of this poem urges everyone to join hands and cherish a better future not only for Americans but for the whole world. She hints at the voices of the rock, river, and tree to draw home the fact that nature is not kind anymore. Nature has changed a little, she is firm now, but her softness still exists. Therefore, humans have to take a pledge of saving nature as well as for the betterment of humankind.","A Rock, A River, A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed,
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow.
I will give you no hiding place down here.

You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance.
Your mouths spilling words

Armed for slaughter.
The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,
But do not hide your face.

Across the wall of the world,
A River sings a beautiful song. It says,
Come, rest here by my side.

Each of you, a bordered country,
Delicate and strangely made proud,
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.
Yet today I call you to my riverside,
If you will study war no more. Come,
Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I and the
Tree and the rock were one.
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your
Brow and when you yet knew you still
Knew nothing.
The River sang and sings on.

There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing River and the wise Rock.
So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew
The African, the Native American, the Sioux,
The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek
The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,
The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,
The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.
They hear. They all hear
The speaking of the Tree.

They hear the first and last of every Tree
Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.
Plant yourself beside the River.

Each of you, descendant of some passed
On traveller, has been paid for.
You, who gave me my first name, you,
Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you
Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then
Forced on bloody feet,
Left me to the employment of
Other seekers—desperate for gain,
Starving for gold.
You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,
You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,
Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare
Praying for a dream.
Here, root yourselves beside me.
I am that Tree planted by the River,
Which will not be moved.
I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree
I am yours—your passages have been paid.
Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you.
History, despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived, but if faced
With courage, need not be lived again.

Lift up your eyes upon
This day breaking for you.
Give birth again
To the dream.

Women, children, men,
Take it into the palms of your hands,
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need. Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self.
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For a new beginning.
Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness.

The horizon leans forward,
Offering you space to place new steps of change.
Here, on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out and upon me, the
Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.
No less to Midas than the mendicant.
No less to you now than the mastodon then.

Here, on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sister’s eyes, and into
Your brother’s face, your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope—
Good morning.",https://poets.org/poem/pulse-morning
The Butterfly by Alice Freeman Palmer,Alice Freeman Palmer,"'The Butterfly' by Alice Freeman Palmer is a short and pleasing poem that describes the heavenly beauty the speaker captured in a gracious butterfly as a child. The speaker of the poem talks with a butterfly that has come to the linden tree. She was playing under the tree. After discovering that “exquisite” butterfly, she could not help but go near it. Thereafter, she held it with her hands carefully. Now, while she holds the creature in her hand, she can observe its marvelous beauty closely. She cannot decode the “eternal mystery” of the butterfly. Once it was a caterpillar creeping in the dust. But, now being a butterfly, it does not have its previous ugliness. This mystery enthralls the speaker and all she wants to break her chrysalis just like the butterfly.","I hold you at last in my hand,
Exquisite child of the air.
Can I ever understand
How you grew to be so fair?

You came to my linden tree
To taste its delicious sweet,
I sitting here in the shadow and shine
Playing around its feet.

Now I hold you fast in my hand,
You marvelous butterfly,
Till you help me to understand
The eternal mystery.

From that creeping thing in the dust
To this shining bliss in the blue!
God give me courage to trust
I can break my chrysalis too!",https://rainydaypoems.com/poems-for-kids/bug-poems/the-butterfly-by-alice-freeman-palmer/
Casehistory: Alison (Head Injury) by U.A. Fanthorpe,U.A. Fanthorpe,"In short form, Alison, the poem's speaker, is looking at a photograph of her younger self. Through Fanthorpe's diction, it is evident that Alison has suffered a head injury, which makes it difficult for her to remember the events and people that have made up her life. She looks at the girl in the picture with envy, realizing how much easier her younger self has it, and simultaneously pitying her younger self for not knowing what lies ahead. 'Casehistory: Alison (head injury)' is a poem, which you can read in full here, brimming with sadness and tragedy.","(She looks at her photograph)

I would like to have known
My husband's wife, my mother's only daughter.
A bright girl she was.

Enmeshed in comforting
Fat, I wonder at her delicate angles.
Her autocratic knee

Like a Degas dancer's
Adjusts to the observer with an airy poise
That now lugs me upstairs
Hardly. Her face, broken
By nothing sharper than smiles, holds in its smiles
What I have forgotten.

She knows my father's dead
And grieves for it, and smiles. she has digested
Mourning. Her smile shows it.

I, who need reminding
Every morning, shall never get over what
i do not remember.

Consistency matters.
I should like to keep faith with her lack of faith,
But forget her reasons.

Proud of this younger self,
I assert her achievements, her A levels,
Her job with a future.

Poor clever girl! I know,
For all my damaged brain , something she doesn't:
I am her future.

A bright girl she was.",https://genius.com/U-a-fanthorpe-casehistory-alison-head-injury-annotated
Winter Song by Elizabeth Tollett,Elizabeth Tollett,"'Winter Song' by Elizabeth Tollett is a poem in which a speaker declares their unending dedication to their lover. In the first of this poem, the speaker begins by telling her lover that she is tired of being challenged in her commitment to him. She uses the rest of the poem to suggest a variety of difficult scenarios and how she would contend with them. She would support him in fights against powerful enemies, join him in the darkest of night, and live with him in the wild world, sleeping on a bed of moss and protecting him from harm.","Ask me no more, my truth to prove,
What I would suffer for my love.
With thee I would in exile go
To regions of eternal snow,
O'er floods by solid ice confined,
Through forest bare with northern wind:
While all around my eyes I cast,
Where all is wild and all is waste.
If there the tim rous stag you chase,
Or rouse to fight a fiercer race,
Undaunted I thy arms would bear,
And give thy hand the hunter's spear.
When the low sun withdraws his light,
And menaces an half-year's night,
The conscious moon and stars above
Shall guide me with my wand'ring love.
Beneath the mountain's hollow brow,
Or in its rocky cells below,
Thy rural feast I would provide.
Nor envy palaces their pride.
The softest moss should dress thy bed,
With savage spoils about thee spread:
While faithful love the watch should keep,
To banish danger from thy sleep.",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/winter-song-7
The Birds of America by Billy Collins,Billy Collins,"'The Birds of America' by Billy Collins contains a vision of Audubon as he imagines a world without barriers between human and non-human animals. The poem begins with the speaker explaining that early “this morning” he was in bed. While relaxing there, he saw a moving image of the naturalist John J. Audubon on his ceiling. The man was kneeling down next to a duck he shot and speaking to it. Through Audubon's words, the speaker explains why the duck was shot and what Audubon hoped would come of the death. By giving a larger percentage of the population a chance to study animals in detail, specifically birds, the speaker believes Audubon wanted to bridge the gap between the species. Perhaps, a viewer would come to love and understand the bird as they never have.","Early this morning
in a rumpled bed,
listening to birdsong
through the propped-open windows,

I saw on the ceiling
the figure of John J. Audubon
kneeling before
the pliant body of an expired duck.

I could see its slender, limp neck, 
rich chestnut crown,
and soft grey throat,
and bright red bill,

even the strange pink legs.
And when I closed my eyes again
I could hear him whisper 
in his hybrid Creole accent

I have taken your life
so that some night a man
might open a book
and run his hand over your feathers,

so that he could come close enough
to study your pale brown flecks,
your white chin patch,
and the electric green of your neck,

so that he might approach
without frightening you into the sky,
and wonder how strange
to the earth he has become,

so that he might see by his lamp light
the glistening in your eye
then take to the air
and fly alongside you.",https://www.thenatureofthings.blog/2019/05/poetry-sunday-birds-of-america-by-billy.html
Mandalay by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling,"Mandalay' by Rudyard Kipling features the reminiscences of a soldier looking back on his time in Burma alongside a woman he loved. The stanzas of this poem are fairly straightforward as the speaker walks the reader through the moments surrounding his encounter with a specific woman. He met her in Burma, and now after he's left, he's longing for her. The soldier describes his distaste for London and the simple fact that he'd like to be somewhere else, somewhere unfamiliar and exotic. Throughout the poem, Kipling makes references to people and places as well as customs in Burma that his speaker familiarized himself with. This helps create a very specific atmosphere for his memories and allows them to contrast well against the soldier's present home.","By the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin' lazy at the sea,
There's a Burma girl a-settin', and I know she thinks o' me;
For the wind is in the palm-trees, and the temple-bells they say:
""Come you back, you British soldier; come you back to Mandalay!""
Come you back to Mandalay,
Where the old Flotilla lay:
Can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin' from Rangoon to Mandalay?
On the road to Mandalay,
Where the flyin'-fishes play,
An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!
'Er petticoat was yaller an' 'er little cap was green,
An' 'er name was Supi-yaw-lat — jes' the same as Theebaw's Queen,
An' I seed her first a-smokin' of a whackin' white cheroot,
An' a-wastin' Christian kisses on an 'eathen idol's foot:
Bloomin' idol made o'mud —
Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd —
Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed 'er where she stud!
On the road to Mandalay . . .
When the mist was on the rice-fields an' the sun was droppin' slow,
She'd git 'er little banjo an' she'd sing ""~Kulla-lo-lo!~""
With 'er arm upon my shoulder an' 'er cheek agin' my cheek
We useter watch the steamers an' the ~hathis~ pilin' teak.
Elephints a-pilin' teak
In the sludgy, squdgy creek,
Where the silence 'ung that 'eavy you was 'arf afraid to speak!
On the road to Mandalay . . .
But that's all shove be'ind me — long ago an' fur away,
An' there ain't no 'busses runnin' from the Bank to Mandalay;
An' I'm learnin' 'ere in London what the ten-year soldier tells:
""If you've 'eard the East a-callin', you won't never 'eed naught else.""
No! you won't 'eed nothin' else
But them spicy garlic smells,
An' the sunshine an' the palm-trees an' the tinkly temple-bells;
On the road to Mandalay . . .
I am sick o' wastin' leather on these gritty pavin'-stones,
An' the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones;
Tho' I walks with fifty 'ousemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand,
An' they talks a lot o' lovin', but wot do they understand?
Beefy face an' grubby 'and —
Law! wot do they understand?
I've a neater, sweeter maiden in a cleaner, greener land!
On the road to Mandalay . . .
Ship me somewheres east of Suez, where the best is like the worst,
Where there aren't no Ten Commandments an' a man can raise a thirst;
For the temple-bells are callin', an' it's there that I would be —
By the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea;
On the road to Mandalay,
Where the old Flotilla lay,
With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay!
On the road to Mandalay,
Where the flyin'-fishes play,
An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!",https://allpoetry.com/Mandalay
The Animals by Edwin Muir,Edwin Muir,"The Animals' by Edwin Muir describes the creation of non-human animals and the inherent vulnerability that stems from their inability to speak for themselves. The poem begins with the speaker stating that animals live in a world that does not feel the touch of time. They are elevated above humanity and remembered as they were before God made humankind. Additionally, he makes it clear that they have a weakness. They are unable to speak for themselves. This factor has made their lives more tenuous. In the following stanzas, the speaker describes the creation of the world. He is recalling or imagining the day on which all manner of elements existed and animals were created. It was here, before humans were made, that there was peace. Animals moved freely, without restraint throughout the world. Although one cannot return to this time, it is possible to imagine. ","They do not live in the world,
Are not in time and space.
From birth to death hurled
No word do they have, not one
To plant a foot upon,
Were never in any place.

For with names the world was called
Out of the empty air,
With names was built and walled,
Line and circle and square,
Dust and emerald;
Snatched from deceiving death
By the articulate breath.

But these have never trod
Twice the familiar track,
Never never turned back
Into the memoried day.
All is new and near
In the unchanging Here
Of the fifth great day of God,
That shall remain the same,
Never shall pass away.

On the sixth day we came",https://allpoetry.com/The-Animals
Dear Basketball by Kobe Bryant – A Love Poem to Basketball,Kobe Bryant,"Dear Basketball' by Kobe Bryant is a moving poem that was written as an announcement of the Lakers star's retirement from basketball. The letter, which is in the form of a poem, separated into stanzas, takes the reader through Bryant's emotional connection to the game. He describes what it was like to find it as a child and then to work hard to do the sport justice. His love for basketball shines through in every line of 'Dear Basketball.' The poem/letter then concludes with Bryant announcing his retirement.","Dear Basketball,
From the moment
I started rolling my dad’s tube socks
And shooting imaginary
Game-winning shots
In the Great Western Forum
I knew one thing was real:
I fell in love with you.
A love so deep I gave you my all
From my mind & body
To my spirit & soul.
As a six-year-old boy
Deeply in love with you
I never saw the end of the tunnel.
I only saw myself
Running out of one.
And so I ran.
I ran up and down every court
After every loose ball for you.
You asked for my hustle
I gave you my heart
Because it came with so much more.
I played through the sweat and hurt
Not because challenge called me
But because YOU called me.
I did everything for YOUBecause that’s what you do
When someone makes you feel as
Alive as you’ve made me feel.
You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream
And I’ll always love you for it.
But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.
This season is all I have left to give.
My heart can take the pounding
My mind can handle the grind
But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.
And that’s OK.
I’m ready to let you go.
I want you to know now
So we both can savor every moment we have left together.
The good and the bad.
We have given each other
All that we have.
And we both know, no matter what I do next
I’ll always be that kid
With the rolled up socks
Garbage can in the corner
:05 seconds on the clock
Ball in my hands.
5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1
Love you always,
Kobe",https://www.tamuk.edu/artsci/_files_COAS/Lang/Favorite-Poems-TAMUK/Dear-Basketball-by-Kobe-Bryant.pdf
The Laburnum Top by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"'The Laburnum Top' by Ted Hughes describes the top of a laburnum tree and captures the activity of the birds living in it. 'The Laburnum Top' by Ted Hughes begins with the description of the “Laburnum top”. Suddenly, a goldfinch comes and breaks the silence on the tree-top. It enters through the thickness of the laburnum leaves to its nest. And, the tree awakes from its slumber and enjoys the “chitterings”, “tremor of wings”, and “trillings” of the birds. It seems like the tree is trembling and thrilled by their presence. But, when the mother goldfinch launches herself away from the branches to the sky, the tree again comes to its previous state.","The Laburnum top is silent, quite still
In the afternoon yellow September sunlight,
A few leaves yellowing, all its seeds fallen.
Till the goldfinch comes, with a twitching chirrup
A suddenness, a startlement, at a branch end.
Then sleek as a lizard, and alert, and abrupt,
She enters the thickness, and a machine starts up
Of chitterings, and a tremor of wings, and trillings —
The whole tree trembles and thrills.
It is the engine of her family.
She stokes it full, then flirts out to a branch-end
Showing her barred face identity mask
Then with eerie delicate whistle-chirrup whisperings
She launches away, towards the infinite
And the laburnum subsides to empty.",https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?kehb1=3-14
Song-Books of the War by Siegfried Sassoon,Siegfried Sassoon,"The poem, Song-Books of the War, which you can read in full here, takes place years after the First World War is over; its idea of revisionist history is that the terrible leadership has been forgotten, the casualties immortalized in stone and bronze, and the pain and anguish of serving has become a game. However, Sassoon details the truth in the voice of a man, then a grandfather, who speaks plainly about the truth of the war.","In fifty years, when peace outshines
Remembrance of the battle lines,
Adventurous lads will sigh and cast
Proud looks upon the plundered past.
On summer morn or winter's night,
Their hearts will kindle for the fight,
Reading a snatch of soldier-song,
Savage and jaunty, fierce and strong;
And through the angry marching rhymes
Of blind regret and haggard mirth,
They'll envy us the dazzling times
When sacrifice absolved our earth.

Some ancient man with silver locks
Will lift his weary face to say:
'War was a fiend who stopped our clocks
Although we met him grim and gay.'
And then he'll speak of Haig's last drive,
Marvelling that any came alive
Out of the shambles that men built
And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt.
But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance,
Will think, 'Poor grandad's day is done.'
And dream of lads who fought in France
And lived in time to share the fun.",https://allpoetry.com/Song-Books-Of-The-War
A Pæan by Edgar Allan Poe,Edgar Allan Poe,"'A Pæan' by Edgar Allan Poe describes the feelings experienced by a husband as he views his dead wife and his desire to sing a “pæan” rather than a “requiem.” The poem begins with the speaker trying to figure out how the “burial rites” are going to be read for the death of someone he loves. He does not yet know whether a solemn or joyous song will be sung. The speaker takes the reader to the side of the body. There, many are gathered. They mourn over her departure, crying and weeping unnecessarily. He believes that their actions dishonor her. They should not mourn but celebrate. In contrast, the mourners do not believe that the speaker should sing the songs he is singing. His voice is weak and they wish him to sing something sadder. He refuses, hits the coffin, and uses the reverberations as a part of his song. When he addresses the dead woman, who the reader learns is his wife, he tells her that while she may be dead her spirit lives on. Her love touched everything around her, so he will not mourn. He will sing a “pæan” to celebrate her life rather than a “requiem” to mourn it.","I. How shall the burial rite be read?
The solemn song be sung?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
That ever died so young?
II. Her friends are gazing on her,
And on her gaudy bier,
And weep!—oh! to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear!
III. They loved her for her wealth—
And they hated her for her pride—
But she grew in feeble health,
And they love her—that she died.
IV. They tell me (while they speak
Of her ""costly broider'd pall"")
That my voice is growing weak—
That I should not sing at all—
V. Or that my tone should be
Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully—so mournfully,
That the dead may feel no wrong.
VI. But she is gone above,
With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead, who is my bride.—
VII. Of the dead—dead who lies
All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
And the life upon her hair.
VIII. Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike—the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
Shall be the accompaniment.
IX. Thou diedst in thy life's June—
But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.
X. From more than friends on earth,
Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven.—
XI. Therefore, to thee this night
I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
With a Pæan of old days.",https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/147/the-works-of-edgar-allan-poe/5375/a-paean/
Postcard from a Travel Snob by Sophie Hannah,Sophie Hannah,"Postcard from a Travel Snob is written in four stanzas of four lines each, with uneven rhyming; in the first stanza, the rhyme follows the pattern of ABAC, in the second it is DEFE, the third GHGI, and the fourth JKJK; it is only the last stanza that has both sets of lines rhyming. It takes place in a resort town, and tells the story of a 'travel snob' who is writing a postcard to someone unspecified about how her holiday is superior to everyone else's holiday, and how it is helping her to enrich and brighten her life. It is a short, but humourous, look at the vanity of people, the natural competitiveness of people, and the ease of pretending to be who you might not wholly be. It also forms part of the GCSE pack of poems, which are a group of poems that occur in GCSE English exams.","I do not wish that anyone were here.
This place is not a holiday resort
with karaoke nights and pints of beer
for drunken tourist types – perish the thought.

This is a peaceful place, untouched by man –
not like your seaside-town-consumer-hell.
I’m sleeping in a local farmer’s van –
it’s great. There’s not a guest house or hotel

within a hundred miles. Nobody speaks
English (apart from me, and rest assured,
I’m not your sun-and-sangria-two-weeks
small-minded-package-philistine-abroad).
When you’re as multi-cultural as me,
your friends become wine connoisseurs, not drunks.

I am an anthropologist in trunks.",https://genius.com/Sophie-hannah-postcard-from-a-travel-snob-annotated
Epitaph on a Tyrant by W.H. Auden,W.H. Auden,"'Epitaph on a Tyrant' by W.H. Auden is a poem that was likely inspired by the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by describing how a tyrant, who remains nameless throughout the poem, was after “a kind” of “Perfection.” He wrote easy-to-understand poetry, believed he understood human folly and had a great interest in “armies and fleets.” Those around him did everything they could to maintain the tyrant's goodwill, but when he was unhappy or angry, “little children died in the streets.”","Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after,
And the poetry he invented was easy to understand;
He knew human folly like the back of his hand,
And was greatly interested in armies and fleets;
When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,
And when he cried the little children died in the streets.",https://poets.org/poem/epitaph-tyrant
To the New Year by W. S. Merwin,W.S. Merwin,"Beginning with sunrise, 'To the New Year' by W. S. Merwin focuses on the coming of a new day. New Year's Day begins with a 'first sunlight', silently touching the tops of the trees. The birds begin to wake, making noise that wakes the world with its coming. Although untouchable, Merwin describes New Year as a feeling, making something 'possible' into a series of sounds and sights felt only on this day.","With what stillness at last
you appear in the valley
your first sunlight reaching down
to touch the tips of a few
high leaves that do not stir
as though they had not noticed
and did not know you at all
then the voice of a dove calls
from far away in itself
to the hush of the morning

so this is the sound of you
here and now whether or not
anyone hears it this is
where we have come with our age
our knowledge such as it is
and our hopes such as they are
invisible before us
untouched and still possible",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54327/to-the-new-year
Bearded Oaks by Robert Penn Warren,Robert Penn Warren,"Bearded Oaks' by Robert Penn Warren is a complex, image-rich poem that describes an eternal moment between two lovers. In the first part of the poem, Warren's speaker depicts a scene of peace. Two lovers rest on the forest floor looking up at the sky and trees. The speaker focuses on the power of the marine-like sky above them and the forest floor below. As Warren put it, the two are laying in the forest after the sun goes down and it feels as “though the lovers were submerged in the water”. They are submerged in human history just as the coral is submerged beneath the ocean. The two are trapped in a small amount of time they have.","The oaks, how subtle and marine,
Bearded, and all the layered light
Above them swims; and thus the scene,
Recessed, awaits the positive night.

So, waiting, we in the grass now lie
Beneath the languorous tread of light:
The grassed, kelp-like, satisfy
The nameless motions of the air.

Upon the floor of light, and time,
Unmurmuring, of polyp made,
We rest; we are, as light withdraws,
Twin atolls on a shelf of shade.

Ages to our construction went,
Dim architecture, hour by hour:
And violence, forgot now, lent
The present stillness all its power.

The storm of noon above us rolled,
Of light the fury, furious gold,
The long drag troubling us, the depth:
Dark is unrocking, unrippling, still.

Passion and slaughter, ruth, decay
descend, minutely whispering down,
Silted down swaying streams, to lay
Foundation for our voicelessness.

All our debate is voiceless here,
As all our rage, the rage of stone;
If hope is hopeless, then fearless is fear,
And history is thus undone.

Our feet once wrought the hollow street
With echo when the lamps were dead
All windows, once our headlight glare
Disturbed the doe that, leaping fled.

I do not love you less that now
The caged heart makes iron stroke,
Or less that all that light once gave
The graduate dark should now revoke.

We live in time so little time
And we learn all so painfully,
That we may spare this hour's term
To practice for eternity.",https://inwardboundpoetry.blogspot.com/2006/10/235-bearded-oaks-robert-penn-warren.html
Danse Russe by William Carlos Williams,William Carlos Williams,"While William Carlos Williams' wife is still sleeping, he creeps out into another room and begins to dance in front of a mirror while completely naked. The sun is shining through the windows, it is a beautiful day, and WCW takes this moment of solitude to joyfully prance around his room. He admires his body and then pronounces himself 'the happy genius of my household'. Danse Russe is comic, enjoyable and lighthearted, with Williams overcoming the lack of connection he tends to feel with others and focusing on his own sense of self.","If I when my wife is sleeping
and the baby and Kathleen
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc
in silken mists
above shining trees,—
if I in my north room
dance naked, grotesquely
before my mirror
waving my shirt round my head
and singing softly to myself:
“I am lonely, lonely.
I was born to be lonely,
I am best so!”
If I admire my arms, my face,
my shoulders, flanks, buttocks
against the yellow drawn shades,—

Who shall say I am not
the happy genius of my household?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46483/danse-russe
Half Omen Half Hope by Joanna Klink,Joanna Klink,"‘Half Omen Half Hope’ by Joanna Klink is a rumination on love and falling out of love. She asks the question, are the happy moments of a relationship worth the sadness that comes after it ends? The title balances this idea, with the ‘omen’ of a broken future mirrored by the ‘hope’ that it can continue forever. The poem is beautiful to read, filled with imagery and complex ideas of love and heartbreak. Klink talks about love as if it were something that fills the body up, and something that can just as easily leave someone hollow. Yet, for Klink, these moments of heartbreak are justified by ‘all the stars’ that populate the relationship with beautiful memories, ones that last forever.","When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked,
When their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable,
They will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers
Against hills in the cooler hours before dark, and the moss at the foot of the forest
When green starts to leave it. What they take into their privacy (half of his embrace,
Her violence at play) are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them.
Moons unearth them. And when, in their separate dwellings, their bodies
Feel the next season come, they no longer have anyone to whom
To tell it. Clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness
Peers back in. If they love, it is solely to be adored, it is to scatter and gather
Themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set.
In the quiet woods, from the highest trees, there is always something
Weightless falling; and he, who must realize that certain losses are irreparable,
Tells himself at night, before the darkest mirror, that vision keeps him whole.

On the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves
Are like sheets of dark water, or ice forests, or husks of ships. To stop a thing
Such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person’s
Thoughts. The imprint they make on each other’s bodies is worth any pain
They may have caused. Quiet falls around them. And when she reaches
For him the air greens like underwater light and the well-waters drop.
They will see again the shadows of insects.
They will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed
Into them. If what is no longer present in them cannot be restored,
It can at least be offered. Through long bewildered dusks, stalks grow;
Rains fill and pass out of clouds; animals hover at the edges of fields
With eyes like black pools. For nothing cannot be transformed;
Pleasure and failure feed each other daily. Do not think any breeze,
Any grain of light, shall be withheld. All the stars will sail out for them.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56440/half-omen-half-hope
The Chamber Over the Gate by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The Chamber Over the Gate, written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, is a poem filled with emotion, faith, and history. Longfellow wrote the piece about a father who had lost his son, in a way that only a father could and informs his story with a powerful and biblical source. In The Chamber Over the Gate, Longfellow focuses on the grief David feels for Absalom, and the way that grief resounds throughout Jerusalem. The biblical account that informs the poem, however, tells the story of a son who fought against his father in every way, by slaying another of his sons, and by usurping his throne. And yet, at the end of it all, David feels nothing but remorse and grief for his fallen son, and never stops being the man’s father, even in the wake of his betrayals. This incredible love that a father can feel for his son is at the heart of Longfellow’s work, and the message resounds as surely as David’s grief did throughout the city of Jerusalem.","Is it so far from thee

Thou canst no longer see,

In the Chamber over the Gate,

That old man desolate,

Weeping and wailing sore

For his son, who is no more?

O Absalom, my son! 


Is it so long ago

That cry of human woe

From the walled city came,

Calling on his dear name,

That it has died away

In the distance of to-day?

O Absalom, my son!

There is no far or near,

There is neither there nor here,

There is neither soon nor late,

In that Chamber over the Gate,

Nor any long ago

To that cry of human woe,

O Absalom, my son! 

–

From the ages that are past

The voice sounds like a blast,

Over seas that wreck and drown,

Over tumult of traffic and town;

And from ages yet to be

Come the echoes back to me,

O Absalom, my son!

Somewhere at every hour

The watchman on the tower

Looks forth, and sees the fleet

Approach of the hurrying feet

Of messengers, that bear

The tidings of despair.

O Absalom, my son! 

–

He goes forth from the door

Who shall return no more.

With him our joy departs;

The light goes out in our hearts;

In the Chamber over the Gate

We sit disconsolate.

O Absalom, my son!

That ‘t is a common grief

Bringeth but slight relief;

Ours is the bitterest loss,

Ours is the heaviest cross;

And forever the cry will be

‘Would God I had died for thee,

O Absalom, my son!’",https://poemanalysis.com/henry-wadsworth-longfellow/the-chamber-over-the-gate/
Follower by Seamus Heaney,Seamus Heaney,"'Follower' by Seamus Heaney is a retrospective piece that describes how the poet used to go plowing with his father in his childhood days. The first half of this piece is a worshipful description by a son of his father, as he remembers how he looked and acted as he plowed their fields. The father is described as being powerful, strong beyond measure, and in total control of his “team.” The furrows he plows are pristine, and the son follows clumsily behind, unable to emulate his father's strength. In the very last stanza of the poem the roles are reversed and the speaker is now the strong one with his father depending on him and following him as he plows.","My father worked with a horse-plough,
His shoulders globed like a full sail strung
Between the shafts and the furrow.
The horses strained at his clicking tongue.

An expert. He would set the wing
And fit the bright steel-pointed sock.
The sod rolled over without breaking.
At the headrig, with a single pluck

Of reins, the sweating team turned round
And back into the land. His eye
Narrowed and angled at the ground,
Mapping the furrow exactly.

I stumbled in his hobnailed wake,
Fell sometimes on the polished sod;
Sometimes he rode me on his back
Dipping and rising to his plod.

I wanted to grow up and plough,
To close one eye, stiffen my arm.
All I ever did was follow
In his broad shadow round the farm.

I was a nuisance, tripping, falling,
Yapping always. But today
It is my father who keeps stumbling
Behind me, and will not go away",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57371/follower
Feather or a Rock by Ellen Welcker,Ellen Welcker,"'Feather or a Rock' by Ellen Welcker is a deep but playful discussion between two friends about the problems associated with their position in society. The poem begins with the speakers stating two factors that make their lives hard to understand and navigate. There is an ever-present choice between loving and/or being a “feather or a rock.” The poem continues with the two complementing one another and the strength they maintain to get through everyday life. Eventually, the second speaker refers to life as being filled with “persistent dread.” The darkness of this moment is offset with playful banter between the two. The poem concludes with the first speaker referencing “martial law” and the Garden of Eden as the source of many of their problems.","which do you love more
a feather or a rock
to be good is to be ‘natural’
I mean to appear
you are not good
you are holding up though
you are holding up
you are getting a drink of water
you are eating
you are concealing your identities
this is like a riotous wilderness
but more like a persistent dread
your ferocity, almost mycological
mythological
I said mycological
oh god
oh my god
your laughter has undertones
of oak and berries
and martial law
conceived, as it were, in a garden",https://poets.org/poem/girls-speak-each-other-common-tongue-feather-or-rock
Without That Once Clear Aim (XXI) by Stephen Spender,Stephen Spender,"'Without That Once Clear Aim' explores a sense of desolation experienced by the artist as they tussle with their circumstances. The poem begins by lamenting the loss of artistic clarity and quickly goes on to blame this loss on the writer's historical circumstances. The poet regards their environment as stifling, claustrophobic, and utterly incompatible with poetic expression. However, it becomes clear that he also regards poetry as his best chance of transcending the horrors that surround him, and so feels compelled to keep writing as best he can. Like many of Stephen Spender's poems, 'Without That Once Clear Aim' is widely studied both in the UK and elsewhere.","Without that once clear aim, the path of flight
To follow for a lifetime through white air,
This century chokes me under the roots of night
I suffer like history in Dark Ages, where
Truth lies in dungeons, from which drifts no whisper:
We hear of towers long broken off from sight
And tortures and war, in dark and smoky rumor,
But on men’s buried lives there falls no light.
Watch me who walk through coiling streets where rain
And fog drown every cry: at corners of day
Road drills explore new areas of pain,
Nor summer nor light may reach down here to play.
The city builds its horror in my brain,
This writing is my only wings away.","https://rihlajourney.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/without-that-once-clear-aim-the-path-of-flight-stephen-spender/#:~:text=And%20tortures%20and%20war%2C%20in,lives%20there%20falls%20no%20light."
Songs of the Spavinaw by Ruth Muskrat Bronson,Ruth Muskrat Bronson,"'Songs of the Spavinaw' by Ruth Muskrat Bronson describes the powers, abilities, and fears of a river that is at the mercy of humankind. The poem begins with the speaker stating that it is “the river Spavinaw.” It was once in control of the highs and lows of the surrounding areas but now it has been forced to “withdraw” into the hills and away from the plain. It once provoked happiness in those around it and was described with such words as “dimple, sparkle and ripple.” This time has passed and now it is forced to contend with a new world. It retreats to the “north” but even here it must fight.","I am the river of Spavinaw,
I am the river of pain;
Sadness and gladness must answer my law;
Measure for measure I give, and withdraw
Back through the hills of the Spavinaw,
Hiding away from the plain.
I am the river of Spavinaw;
I sing the songs of the world;
Dashing and whirling, swishing and swirling,
Delicate, mystical, silvery spray hurling,
Sing I the songs of the world,
The passionate songs of the world.
I sing of laughter and mirth,
And I laugh in a gurgle of glee
As the myriad joys of the earth
Trip through the light with me.
Gay shallows dimple, sparkle and ripple.
Like songs that a lover would sing,
Skipping in moonlight,
Tripping in moonlight,
Whispering echoes of spring.
And again
I move with the slow sadness of pain.
In my dark blue deep, where the shadows creep,
I catch up life’s sorrows and mirror them back again.
And my song is a throbbing, pitiful sobbing,
Choked by an agonized pain.
And then
I move forth toward the beckoning north,
And I sing of the power of men.
As I dash down my falls,
As I beat at my walls
Frantically fighting, running and righting,
All through the flood, through the snarling and biting,
I sing of the power of men,
Of the hurry and power of men.
I am the river of Spavinaw,
I am the giver of pain;
Sadness and gladness must answer my law;
Measure for measure I give, and withdraw
Back through the hills of the Spavinaw,
Hiding away from the plain.",https://poemanalysis.com/ruth-muskrat-bronson/songs-of-the-spavinaw/
From the Journal of a Disappointed Man by Andrew Motion,Andrew Motion,'From the Journal of a Disappointed Man' by Andrew Motion describes the actions of construction workers who labor to build a pier. The poem takes the reader through the narrator's initial impression of the men and then how that impression evolves as he studies them. He admits his fascination with their actions and minds and eventually comes to different conclusions about their inner lives and the dynamic between them and the rest of the world.,"I discovered these men driving a new pile into the pier.
There was all the paraphernalia
of chains, pulleys, cranes, ropes and, as I said,
a wooden pile, a massive affair, swinging

over the water on a long wire hawser.
Everything else was in the massive style
as well, even the men; very powerful men;
very ruminative and silent men ignoring me.

Speech was not something to interest them,
and if they talked at all it was like this –
“Let go”, or “Hold tight”: all monosyllables.
Nevertheless, by paying close attention
to the obscure movements of one working
on a ladder by the water’s edge, I could tell
that for all their strength and experience
these men were up against a great difficulty.

I cannot say what. Every one of the monsters
was silent on the subject – baffled I thought
at first, but then I realised indifferent
and tired of the whole business.

The man nearest to me, still saying nothing
but crossing his strong arms over his chest,
showed me that for all he cared the pile
could go on swinging until the crack of Doom.

I should say I watched them at least an hour
and, to do the men justice, their slow efforts
to overcome the secret problem did continue –
then gradually slackened and finally ceased.

One massive man after another abandoned
his position and leaned on the iron rail
to gaze down like a mystic into the water.
No one spoke; no one said what they saw;



though one fellow did spit, and with round eyes
followed the trajectory of his brown bolus
(he had been chewing tobacco)
on its slow descent into the same depths.

The foreman, and the most original thinker,
smoked a cigarette to relieve the tension.
Afterwards, and with a heavy kind of majesty,
he turned on his heels and walked away.

With this eclipse of interest, the incident
was suddenly closed. First in ones and twos,
then altogether, the men followed. That left
the pile still in mid-air, and me of course.",https://genius.com/Andrew-motion-from-the-journal-of-a-disappointed-man-annotated
Football at Slack by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"'Football at Slack' by Ted Hughes presents a few men who were playing football on a hill and how they enjoyed the sudden appearance of rain. 'Football at Slack' by Ted Hughes presents a beautiful image of a hill and a few men playing football there. In the poem, during the match suddenly the football went down the hill and got stuck on a tree. Those men gathered there and shouted at the ball. But it rolled down in the valley. During this moment, clouds covered the sky and it started raining. The splash of rain made them forget about the ball. Therefore, they started to enjoy the moment. At the end of the poem, the rain stopped and the sun appeared in the sky again like a “golden holocaust”.","Between plunging valleys, on a bareback of hill
Men in bunting colours
Bounced, and their blown ball bounced.

The blown ball jumped, and the merry-coloured men
Spouted like water to head it.
The ball blew away downwind –

The rubbery men bounced after it.
The ball jumped up and out and hung in the wind
Over a gulf of treetops.
Then they all shouted together, and the blown ball blew back.
Winds from fiery holes in heaven
Piled the hills darkening around them
To awe them. The glare light
Mixed its mad oils and threw glooms.
Then the rain lowered a steel press.

Hair plastered, they all just trod water
To puddle glitter. And their shouts bobbed up
Coming fine and thin, washed and happy

While the humped world sank foundering
And the valleys blued unthinkable
Under the depth of Atlantic depression –

But the wingers leapt, they bicycled in air
And the goalie flew horizontal

And once again a golden holocaust
Lifted the cloud’s edge, to watch them.",https://genius.com/Ted-hughes-football-at-slack-annotated
A Simile for Her Smile by Richard Wilbur,Richard Wilbur,"In 'A Simile for Her Smile,' Wilbur admires the smile of his lover by comparing it to the “idling motors” near highway bridge gates. In this poem, the speaker talks about how the thought of his lover's smile alone, or even the hope that she is smiling, is enough to put his mind at ease. He uses the words “pause” and “abrupt ease” to convey his mental state while thinking about her pleasant, smiling face. No matter what he thinks at the moment, the thought of her smile brightens him up. In the rest of the poem, Wilbur describes traffic halting near bridge gates. The scene is frustrating yet tranquil. Wilbur's use of soothing terms sets a calming tone in the entire text, exuding the pleasure of watching his beloved smile.","Your smiling, or the hope, the thought of it,
Makes in my mind such pause and abrupt ease
As when the highway bridgegates fall,
Balking the hasty traffic, which must sit
On each side massed and staring, while
Deliberately the drawbridge starts to rise:
The horns are hushed, the oilsmoke rarefies,
Above the idling motors one can tell
The packet's smooth approach, the slip,
Slip of the silken river past the sides,
The ringing of clear bells, the dip
And slow cascading of the paddle wheel.",https://sharya.tripod.com/poetry/simile.html
Affirmative Action Blues by Elizabeth Alexander,Elizabeth Alexander,"'Affirmative Action Blues' by Elizabeth Alexander is about the police brutality against Rodney King and what the poet thinks of this event. Alexander begins the poem in the present tense with the scene of the trial of four white policemen who brutally beat Rodney King without caring about his civil rights. There were two black men (one King himself and another might be his lawyer) trying to convince the bench of white men that the event, indeed, is in strict violation of civil rights. Then the speaker talks about a separate event at her office where she convinces her boss not to use the word “niggardly” in front of her again. Though this word is tied with the etymology of “nigger” or “negroes”, she somehow feels offended for the resonance of the double “g” sound. Just after the event, she dreams of another scene, where she finds herself in a rodent-filled office that makes her not only feel offended but a bit scared. Her boss advises her to keep her space clean in order to keep these vermin away. In the next lines, Alexander keeps readers engaged in the main subject of the poem that whether the police's actions can be justified. Alongside that, she asks, can African Americans really get along if such events keep occurring in the United States?","I am lazy, the laziest
girl in the world. I sleep during
the day when I want to, 'til
my face is creased and swollen,
'til my lips are dry and hot. I 
eat as I please: cookies and milk
after lunch, butter and sour cream
on my baked potato, foods that
slothful people eat, that turn
yellow and opaque beneath the skin.
Sometimes come dinnertime Sunday
I am still in my nightgown, the one
with the lace trim listing because
I have not mended it. Many days
I do not exercise, only
consider it, then rub my curdy
belly and lie down. Even
my poems are lazy. I use
syllabics instead of iambs,
prefer slant to the gong of full rhyme,
write briefly while others go
for pages. And yesterday,
for example, I did not work at all!
I got in my car and I drove 
to factory outlet stores, purchased
stockings and panties and socks
with my father's money.

To think, in childhood I missed only
one day of school per year. I went
to ballet class four days a week
at four-forty-five and on
Saturdays, beginning always
with plie, ending with curtsy.
To think, I knew only industry,
the industry of my race
and of immigrants, the radio
tuned always to the station
that said, Line up your summer
job months in advance. Work hard
and do not shame your family,
who worked hard to give you what you have.
There is no sin but sloth. Burn
to a wick and keep moving.

I avoided sleep for years,
up at night replaying 
evening news stories about
nearby jailbreaks, fat people
who ate fried chicken and woke up
dead. In sleep I am looking
for poems in the shape of open
V's of birds flying in formation,
or open arms saying, I forgive you, all.",https://poets.org/poem/blues
When I Was One-and-Twenty by A. E. Housman,A. E. Housman,"When I Was One-and-Twenty' by A. E. Housman is a moralistic poem that tells of a young man's mistakes in love, despite being given advice. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes how when he was 21 years old a wise man gave him some advice. He was told that he would have better luck in love if he gave all his money away first. And surprisingly the speaker did not take the Wiseman out his word and so he did not give away his possessions. But, as the poem concludes, the speaker says that now he's 22 and understands not the man was right.","When I was one-and-twenty
I heard a wise man say,
“Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free.”
But I was one-and-twenty,
No use to talk to me.
When I was one-and-twenty
I heard him say again,
“The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain;
’Tis paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue.”
And I am two-and-twenty,
And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52706/when-i-was-one-and-twenty-56d2316642304
Passing And Glassing by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"‘Passing And Glassing‘ by Christina Rossetti speaks on a woman’s age and depicts a powerful new way of understanding the process. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the world is used by women as a looking glass. They look out at its innumerable changes and transformations and see their own path through time. When their worlds change, they know that they are changing too. Death is coming closer and soon they will be among the withered flowers on the ground. In the second stanza, the speaker pushes the idea that just because a beautiful thing has been transformed doesn’t mean that it has lost any of its worth. She gives examples of dried lavender and violets. The final stanza explains how womankind need not subscribe to the societal standards of value and beauty. There is much to be gained through age, such as wisdom on “good and ill.” She also expressed the simple fact that nothing happening now is new. Life on earth is born, ages, and then dies. That is how it’s always been and how it always will be.","All things that pass
Are woman's looking-glass;
They show her how her bloom must fade,
And she herself be laid
With withered roses in the shade;
With withered roses and the fallen peach,
Unlovely, out of reach
Of summer joy that was.

All things that pass
Are woman's tiring-glass;
The faded lavender is sweet,
Sweet the dead violet
Culled and laid by and cared for yet;
The dried-up violets and dried lavender
Still sweet, may comfort her,
Nor need she cry Alas!

All things that pass
Are wisdom's looking-glass;
Being full of hope and fear, and still
Brimful of good or ill,
According to our work and will;
For there is nothing new beneath the sun;
Our doings have been done,
And that which shall be was.",https://poemanalysis.com/christina-rossetti/passing-and-glassing/
Beginning My Studies by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"'Beginning My Studies' by Walt Whitman is a simple poem that addresses the joy the speaker felt when stepping out into the natural world. In six lines the poem depicts for the reader the overwhelming joy the speaker felt upon being able to step outside into nature and investigate. He did not have to go farther than the first step before he knew that he was far enough. The connections between creatures, forms, sights, and sounds thrilled him. The last line states that he wanted to sing out his joy in “ecstatic song,” a clear reference to this poem and all the other poetry Whitman wrote on the theme of nature.","Beginning my studies, the first step pleas’d me so much,
The mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the power of motion,
The least insect or animal—the senses—eyesight—love;
The first step, I say, aw’d me and pleas’d me so much,
I have hardly gone, and hardly wish’d to go, any farther,
But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs.",https://poemanalysis.com/walt-whitman/beginning-my-studies/
The Chambered Nautilus by Oliver Wendell Holmes,Oliver Wendell Holmes,"'The Chambered Nautilus' by Oliver Wendell Holmes it's about the nautilus' life and the lessons one can learn from it. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker describes, in complimentary terms, the struggle that the nautilus engages in as it attempts to construct more perfect compartments within its shell. He speaks about the creature's death, its creation of a new home, and more. As the poem progresses, the speaker addresses the nautilus itself, thanking it for the message it delivers through its existence. The final stanza is addressed to the speaker's soul, asking it to take strength from the nautilus' life and construct evermore perfect structures or improve the speaker's own spirituality and the strength of their soul.","This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
Sails the unshadowed main,—
The venturous bark that flings
On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.

Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
Before thee lies revealed,—
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!

Year after year beheld the silent toil
That spread his lustrous coil;
Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year’s dwelling for the new,
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.

Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
Child of the wandering sea,
Cast from her lap, forlorn!
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
Than ever Triton blew from wreathèd horn!
While on mine ear it rings,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:—

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low-vaulted past!
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
Till thou at length art free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44379/the-chambered-nautilus
The Errigal Road by John Montague,John Montague,"In 'The Errigal Road,' John Montague explores Irish mythological history while advocating for relationships that go beyond contemporary violence. The poem takes the reader through a series of landmarks around Hill Head Road in Northern Ireland. The speaker and his neighbour are exploring the landscape. Montague's speaker depicts the land's history, and the neighbour explains stories and legends that they both can relate to and appreciate. As the walk comes to an end the neighbour asks that the speaker remember the clear-headed conversation they had and tell others that it's possible.","We match paces along the Hill Head Road,
the road to the old churchyard of Errigal Keerogue;
its early cross, a heavy stone hidden in grass.

As we climb, my old Protestant neighbour
signals landmarks along his well trodden path,
some hill or valley celebrated in local myth.

‘Yonder’s Whiskey Hollow,’ he declares,
indicating a line of lunar birches.
We halt to imagine men plotting

against the wind, feeding the fire or
smothering the fumes of an old fashioned worm
while the secret liquid bubbles and clears.

‘And that’s Foxhole Brae under there –’
pointing to the torn face of a quarry.
‘It used to be crawling with them.’

(A red quarry slinks through the heather,
a movement swift as a bird’s, melting as rain,
glimpsed behind a mound, disappears again.)

At Fairy Thorn Height the view fans out,
ruck and rise to where, swathed in mist
& rain, swells the mysterious saddle shape

of Knockmany Hill, its brooding tumulus
opening perspectives beyond our Christian myth.
‘On a clear day you can see far into Monaghan,’

old Eaglesone says, and we exchange sad notes
about the violence plaguing these parts;
last week, a gun battle outside Aughnacloy,

machine-gun fire splintering the wet thords,
two men beaten up near dark Altamuskin,
an attenpt to blow up Omagh Courthouse.

helicopters overhead, hovering locusts.
Heavily booted soldiers probing vehicles, streets,
their strange antennae bristling, like insects.

At his lane’s end, he turns to face me.
‘Tell them down South that old neighbours
can still speak to each other around here’

& gives me his hand, but not not ask me in.
Rain misting my coat, I turn back towards
the main road, where cars whip smartly past

A Vision by Oscar Wilde,Oscar Wilde,"A Vision' by Oscar Wilde describes a speaker's encounter with the personas of Æschylos, Sophokles, and Euripides the three Greek playwrights whose works survive. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he can see two kings and one man without any laurels. It is this person who catches his attention the most. In the following lines, he describes what feelings he gets from this man and the sights which surround his broken tombstone. In the final couplet, it is revealed that the men are the greek playwrights Æschylos, Sophokles, and Euripides. It is Euripides with whom the speaker is so taken. He is deeply interested in the writer's disappointing reception by the public during his lifetime. It is not until after death he is recognized.","TWO crownèd Kings, and One that stood alone
With no green weight of laurels round his head,
But with sad eyes as one uncomforted,
And wearied with man's never-ceasing moan
For sins no bleating victim can atone,
And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed.
Girt was he in a garment black and red,
And at his feet I marked a broken stone
Which sent up lilies, dove-like, to his knees.
Now at their sight, my heart being lit with flame I cried to Beatricé, ""Who are these?""
And she made answer, knowing well each name,
""Æschylos first, the second Sophokles,
And last (wide stream of tears!) Euripides.""",https://allpoetry.com/A-Vision
I Am Not Yours by Sara Teasdale,Sara Teasdale,"I Am Not Yours' by Sara Teasdale describes the emotions of a speaker who is seeking out a love that does not strive to confine her. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she is seeking out a relationship that allows her to become lost in love. This does not seem to be the situation she is currently in as she states that she is “not yours.” The speaker does not belong to the relationship she is currently in, nor to the person who is her partner. In the next lines, she describes her ideal relationship as being one that allows her to become like a “candle lit at noon.” She will be burning amongst a great plethora of light. The next section of lines are used to remind the listener that she does still care about them. It is not exactly this person's fault she is unhappy—they are still “beautiful and bright.” The poem concludes with the speaker stating that she is ready to give herself to a “deep…love” which takes over her sense and sweeps her away like a “taper in a rushing wind.”","I am not yours, not lost in you,
Not lost, although I long to be
Lost as a candle lit at noon,
Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

You love me, and I find you still
A spirit beautiful and bright,
Yet I am I, who long to be
Lost as a light is lost in light.

Oh plunge me deep in love—put out
My senses, leave me deaf and blind,
Swept by the tempest of your love,
A taper in a rushing wind.",https://poets.org/poem/i-am-not-yours
Parting at Morning by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,Parting at Morning' by Robert Browning is a short poem that describes in clear detail what the speaker experienced after leaving his lover in the morning. The first two lines describe the landscape and the next two what's in store for the speaker and the sun. The sun has a path of golden light set ou before it while the speaker wants to and needs to go back to the world of men. There is more for him to do in life than spend time with this lover and at this moment this appears to be something he's glad about.,"Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,
And the sun looked over the mountain's rim:
And straight was a path of gold for him,
And the need of a world of men for me.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43772/parting-at-morning
Historic Evening by Arthur Rimbaud,Arthur Rimbaud,"First Paragraph In whatever evening, for instance, the simple tourist retiring from our economic horrors finds himself, the hand of a master wakes the harpsichord of meadows; cards are played in the depths of the pond, mirror, evoker of queens and favourites; there are saints, sails, and threads of harmony, and legendary chromaticism in the sunset. This first paragraph presents an extensive sentence. The opening of Historic Evening situates the reader in a particular moment of the day, but with no specification of the date or of the hour in which the actions described take place (“In whatever evening”). The lyrical voice depicts the movements of the “simple tourist”, which are also undetermined, and how he/she wants to escape from “economic horrors”. This figure, according to the lyrical voice, is able to discover several things which are listed in the sentence (“the hand of a master wakes the harpsichord of meadows; cards are okayed in the depths of the pond […] evoker of queens and favorites; there are saints, sails, and threads of harmony, and legendary chromaticism in the sunset”). These descriptions use greatly evocative words and build strong natural images, such as that of the pond and of the sunset. Thus, this first paragraph establishes this figure's search over things he/she didn't explore before. Second Paragraph He shudders at the passing of the hunts and the hordes. Drama drips on the platforms of turf. And the superfluity of the poor and the weak on these stupid levels! This second paragraph continues the description of the exploration of the “simple tourist”. The “simple tourist” seems to fear “the hunts and the hordes”. On the next sentences, the lyrical voice will continue to use highly evocative language, as in the first paragraph. The “simple tourist” is still discovering things in this “whatever evening”. Notice the last sentence, and how this is a comment from the lyrical voice towards the understanding of the poor, the weak, and this “simple tourist”. Third Paragraph To his slave's eye, Germany towers upwards toward moons; Tartar deserts light up; ancient revolts foment at the heart of the Celestial Empire; along the stairways and armchairs of rocks a little world, pale and flat, is to be built. Then a ballet of known seas and nights; chemistry without virtue, and impossible melodies. This third paragraph focuses on strong images that appear to the “simple tourist”. This figure sees a vision of the world and how it works. The figure, with his “slave's eye” and “retiring from economic horrors”, sees diverse groups of people. The construction of the first sentence is similar to that of the first paragraph: the figure is mentioned in a certain circumstance and there is an enumeration of the visions he/she has. Notice that the words are greatly evocative and they build strong imagery that continues with the theme used in the previous paragraphs. Fourth Paragraph The same bourgeois magic wherever the packet-boat deposits us! The most elementary physicist feels it is no longer to possible to submit oneself to this personal atmosphere, this fog of physical remorse, observation of which is already an affliction. The fourth paragraph, rather than describing the actions of the figure mentioned, focuses on the lyrical voice. The lyrical voice appears to be making a statement about the historical and cultural context that surrounds both him/her and the figure described (the “simple tourist”). Historic Evening changes its tone and abandons the lyrical descriptions that were made in the previous paragraphs. According to the lyrical voice, it is impossible to escape from the “bourgeois magic” no matter where you go (“wherever the packet-boat deposits us!”). Furthermore, the following sentence describes this feeling of entrapment that the lyrical voice expresses in the first part of the paragraph. Fifth Paragraph No! The moment of the steam room, of evaporating seas, of subterranean conflagrations, of the wandering planet and the consequent exterminations, certainties indicated with so little malice by the Bible and the Norns which it will fall to the serious being to witness – However it will be no matter of legend! The last paragraph expands the message already stated in the fourth paragraph. The lyrical voice continues talking about the “bourgeois magic” and the inability to escape from it (“The moment of the steam room, of evaporating seas, of subterranean conflagrations, of the wandering planet and the consequent exterminations”). The feeling towards the present is reflected in the lyrical voice's description and in the immersion made in the pattern of the elements mentioned. The poem finishes with a strong statement made by the lyrical voice (“However it will be no matter of legend!”). This sentence shows the lyrical voice's reflection on bourgeois life and capitalism. Furthermore, this particular historical moment, according to the lyrical voice, “will be no matter of legend!” opposing his/her present to a much yearned past time.","On an evening, for example, when the naive tourist has retired
from our economic horrors, a master's hand awakens
the meadow's harpsichord;
they are playing cards at the bottom of the pond,
mirror conjuring up favorites and queens;
there are saints, veils, threads of harmony,
and legendary chromatics in the setting sun.
He shudders as the hunts and hordes go by.
Comedy drips on the grass stages.
And the distress of the poor and of the weak
on those stupid planes! Before his slave's vision,
Germany goes scaffolding toward moons;
Tartar deserts light up; ancient revolts ferment
in the center of the Celestial Empire;
over stairways and armchairs of rock, a little world, wan and flat,
Africa and Occidents, will be erected.
Then a ballet of familiar seas and nights,
worthless chemistry and impossible melodies. The same bourgeois magic
wherever the mail-train sets you down.
Even the most elementary physicist feels that it is no longer possible
to submit to this personal atmosphere, fog of physical remorse,
which to acknowledge is already an affliction. No!
The moment of the seething cauldron, of seas removed,
of subterranean conflagrations, of the planet swept away,
and the consequent exterminations, certitudes indicated
with so little malice by the Bible and by the Norns
and for which serious persons should be on the alert",https://allpoetry.com/Historic-Evening
After a Journey by Thomas Hardy,Thomas Hardy,"'After a Journey' by Thomas Hardy tells of a speaker's semi-successful attempts to catch and interview the ghost of his dead lover. The poem begins with the speaker telling the listener, who is the ghost, that he has come to interview her. He knows that she is “Voiceless” but they are able to communicate in other ways. In the first stanza, he describes how much work it took to track the ghost down. She is always leading him off to various locations. Many of these remind him of how lonely he is now. When they do eventually come back together it is in one or more of the places they spent time together when she was alive. The speaker is deeply moved by the familiar sights and sounds. His whole life is improved by the evening and night he's able to spend with her. She has to go when the sun rises, but he doesn't mind. He believes that she will be able to bring him back to the same areas again. They don't have to be apart for the rest of the time. It is possible to have temporary moments that return them to the past. Read more of Thomas Hardy's poetry.","I come to interview a Voiceless ghost;
Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?
Up the cliff, down, till I'm lonely, lost,
And the unseen waters' soliloquies awe me.
Where you will next be there's no knowing,
Facing round about me everywhere,
With your nut-coloured hair,
And gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going.
Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last;
Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you;
What have you now found to say of our past —
Viewed across the dark space wherein I have lacked you?
Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?
Things were not lastly as firstly well
With us twain, you tell?
But all's closed now, despite Time's derision.
I see what you are doing: you are leading me on
To the spots we knew when we haunted here together,
The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone
At the then fair hour in the then fair weather,
And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow
That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago,
When you were all aglow,
And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow!
Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see,
The waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily,
Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me,
For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily.
Trust me, I mind not, though Life lours,
The bringing of me here; nay, bring me here again!
I am just the same as when
Our days were a joy, and our paths through flowers.",https://allpoetry.com/After-A-Journey
Romeo and Juliet Act I Scene 5 Sonnet by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"In the famous sonnet that appears in Act I Scene 5, Romeo and Juliet meet, express their interest and desire for one another, and seal their fates. Within these lines Shakespeare uses an extended metaphor, comparing Romeo to a pilgrim and Juliet to a religious/holy site, to describe their relationship. Romeo acts reverentially, cleverly convincing Juliet to let him kiss her while also treating her as a saint.","SCENE. A hall in Capulet's house.

(Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins)

First Servant
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant
Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

Second Servant
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

CAPULET
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

(Music plays, and they dance)

More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Capulet
By'r lady, thirty years.

CAPULET
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.

CAPULET
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO
[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?

Servant
I know not, sir.

ROMEO
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET
Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

You kiss by the book.

Love Came Down at Christmas by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"'Love Came Down at Christmas' by Christina Rossetti is a religious Christmas poem that since its publication has become a popular Christmas carol. The poem describes “love,” Jesus Christ, coming down from heaven on Christmas. This “love” is on earth for all of humankind to feel and learn from. All those who subscribe to Christianity, and all those who do not, are part of it. Rossetti depicts “love” as “incarnate,” made flesh in a human body. Jesus is the embodiment of divine love and she sought to celebrate that fact through this short and memorable poem.","Love came down at Christmas,
Love all lovely, love divine;
Love was born at Christmas,
Star and angels gave the sign.

Worship we the Godhead,
Love incarnate, love divine;
Worship we our Jesus:
But wherewith for sacred sign?

Love shall be our token,
Love shall be yours and love be mine,
Love to God and to all men,
Love for plea and gift and sign.",https://allpoetry.com/Love-Came-Down-at-Christmas
Untitled Poem by George Henry Boker,George Henry Boker,"This untitled poem by Boker reveals the horrors of the American Civil War, and the aftermath of these horrors. It also reveals the strength of the American people, to hold on to love even in the midst of death and horror and gore. Boker reveals the different ways in which people responded to the war, and he praised those who held on to their humanity in the midst of so much agony. These words paint a picture for the readers of the horrible imagery of war at the doorstep of home. It reveals the way that it changed people and the painful loss that came with it. The ending of the poem suggests that even though Love survived the way, it was accompanied by Death, and the American people, though they pulled through, would never be the same.","Untitled Poem, by George Henry Boker
Blood, blood! The lines of every printed sheet
Through their dark arteries reek with running gore;
At hearth, at board, before the household door,
'T is the sole subject with which neighbors meet.

Prattle of horrors; flash their little store
Of simple jests against the cannon's roar,
As if mere slaughter kept existence sweet.
O, heaven, I quail at the familiar way
This fool, the world, disports his jingling cap;
Murdering or dying with one grin agap!
Our very Love comes draggled from the fray,
Smiling at victory, scowling at mishap,
With gory Death companioned and at play.","loc.gov/rr/program/bib/lcpoetry/boker.html#:~:text=Untitled%20Poem%2C%20by%20George%20Henry%20Boker&text=Of%20simple%20jests%20against%20the,mere%20slaughter%20kept%20existence%20sweet.&text=This%20fool%2C%20the%20world%2C%20disports,dying%20with%20one%20grin%20agap!"
When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be by John Keats,John Keats,"This poem was written in 1818, only a few short years before Keats' own death. It is primarily a poem about Keats' fear of mortality, however in true Keatsian fashion, death is also the solution for more of what ails Keats. It would be prudent to remember that Keats' poems have all, in some way, featured death; death of nature, death of love, death of memory, but death all in all. There are few poems, in fact, that does not reference the ending of things. 'When I have Fears that I may Cease to Be' is effusive with imagery, sensual in its description of the fears that Keats possesses, and short. Keats runs the gamut from worrying about dying before he is famous, worrying about the death of his beloved, and then deciding that death itself is not such a terrible situation.","When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
Before high-pilèd books, in charactery,
Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;
When I behold, upon the night’s starred face,
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting love—then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44488/when-i-have-fears-that-i-may-cease-to-be
How I Got That Name by Marilyn Chin,Marilyn Chin,"'How I Got That Name' by Marilyn Chin is a complex poem about the poet's heritage, name, and cultural identity. Chin spends the poem addressing her life as a Chinese-American immigrant, brought to America when she was young. She notes how her father changed her name at the beginning of the poem, attempting to Americanize it. At the same time, she also discusses her father's personality and the dishonest way that he made his money. Throughout, she tries to explain how difficult it was growing up in two different worlds and trying to get the approval of both. The poet also depicts how she believes her ancestors judge her while also trying to judge herself more fairly.","I am Marilyn Mei Ling Chin
Oh, how I love the resoluteness
of that first person singular
followed by that stalwart indicative
of “be,” without the uncertain i-n-g
of “becoming.” Of course,
the name had been changed
somewhere between Angel Island and the sea,
when my father the paperson
in the late 1950s
obsessed with a bombshell blond
transliterated “Mei Ling” to “Marilyn.”
And nobody dared question
his initial impulse—for we all know
lust drove men to greatness,
not goodness, not decency.
And there I was, a wayward pink baby,
named after some tragic white woman
swollen with gin and Nembutal.
My mother couldn't pronounce the “r.”
She dubbed me “Numba one female offshoot”
for brevity: henceforth, she will live and die
in sublime ignorance, flanked
by loving children and the “kitchen deity.”
While my father dithers,
a tomcat in Hong Kong trash—
a gambler, a petty thug,
who bought a chain of chopsuey joints
in Piss River, Oregon,
with bootlegged Gucci cash.
Nobody dared question his integrity given
his nice, devout daughters
and his bright, industrious sons
as if filial piety were the standard
by which all earthly men are measured.
*
Oh, how trustworthy our daughters,
how thrifty our sons!
How we've managed to fool the experts
in education, statistic and demography—
We're not very creative but not adverse to rote-learning.
Indeed, they can use us.
But the “Model Minority” is a tease.
We know you are watching now,
so we refuse to give you any!
Oh, bamboo shoots, bamboo shoots!
The further west we go, we'll hit east;
the deeper down we dig, we'll find China.
History has turned its stomach
on a black polluted beach—
where life doesn't hinge
on that red, red wheelbarrow,
but whether or not our new lover
in the final episode of “Santa Barbara”
will lean over a scented candle
and call us a “bitch.”
Oh God, where have we gone wrong?
We have no inner resources!
*
Then, one redolent spring morning
the Great Patriarch Chin
peered down from his kiosk in heaven
and saw that his descendants were ugly.
One had a squarish head and a nose without a bridge
Another's profile—long and knobbed as a gourd.
A third, the sad, brutish one
may never, never marry.
And I, his least favorite—
“not quite boiled, not quite cooked,”
a plump pomfret simmering in my juices—
too listless to fight for my people's destiny.
“To kill without resistance is not slaughter”
says the proverb. So, I wait for imminent death.
The fact that this death is also metaphorical
is testament to my lethargy.
*
So here lies Marilyn Mei Ling Chin,
married once, twice to so-and-so, a Lee and a Wong,
granddaughter of Jack “the patriarch”
and the brooding Suilin Fong,
daughter of the virtuous Yuet Kuen Wong
and G.G. Chin the infamous,
sister of a dozen, cousin of a million,
survived by everybody and forgotten by all.
She was neither black nor white,
neither cherished nor vanquished,
just another squatter in her own bamboo grove
minding her poetry—
when one day heaven was unmerciful,
and a chasm opened where she stood.
Like the jowls of a mighty white whale,
or the jaws of a metaphysical Godzilla,
it swallowed her whole.
She did not flinch nor writhe,
nor fret about the afterlife,
but stayed! Solid as wood, happily
a little gnawed, tattered, mesmerized
by all that was lavished upon her
and all that was taken away!",https://poets.org/poem/how-i-got-name
The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner by Randall Jarrell,Randall Jarrell,"'The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner' by Randall Jarrell is a moving poem about the death of a soldier during the Second World War. Throughout the lines of this piece, Jarrell's speaker, a deceased soldier, describes his birth and innocence while juxtaposing it with his job as a gunner and death. The first lines describe how he was born from his mother's dream into “the State” or a new, more violent understanding of life. There, he hunkers down inside a new womb, the ball turret. His days are filled with black flak and nightmarish scenes of life and death. The poem's final line reveals that the speaker is dead, and his remains were washed from the “womb” with a hose.","From my mother’s sleep I fell into the State,
And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.
Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,
I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.

My House is the Red Earth by Joy Harjo,Joy Harjo,"My House is the Red Earth by Joy Harjo describes her 'house', a little red house that many can miss when driving by. Although she has often heard places such as 'New York' being called the centre of the world, for her it is her house. The same applies to different characters explored within the poem, finding different locations that they love and call home. The poem finishes by applying these ideas to animals, with the 'crow' finding its home in food and the sky. ","My house is the red earth; it could be the center of the world. I’ve heard New York, Paris, or Tokyo called the center of the world, but I say it is magnificently humble. You could drive by and miss it. Radio waves can obscure it. Words cannot construct it, for there are some sounds left to sacred wordless form. For instance, that fool crow, picking through trash near the corral, understands the center of the world as greasy strips of fat. Just ask him. He doesn’t have to say that the earth has turned scarlet through fierce belief, after centuries of heartbreak and laughter—he perches on the blue bowl of the sky, and laughs.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51640/my-house-is-the-red-earth
I Have News by Juliette A. H. Cavendish,Juliette Cavendish,"'I Have News' by Juliette A. H. Cavendish is a powerful poem written in the wake of an important loss. The speaker spends the first stanza of the poem describing their reaction to a piece of news, someone they care deeply for has passed away. This person, who goes unnamed and mostly undescribed throughout the poem was incredibly close to them. They're surrounded by a new emptiness that makes them feel both raw and numb. The funeral occurs, and the speaker considers the nature of death and the rituals surrounding burying someone. After the person is gone, and an amount of time has passed, the speaker still finds themselves moved by the loss. They go to their lost loved one's grave and lie on the ground, as close to this person as they can be. The poem concludes with a final image of loss and darkness as the speaker contends with the new silence in their life.","I have news relayed, and me sinking, falling somewhere
Depths of unfamiliar raw and numb
Lost with colour faded, heart of lead
But news of magnitude with need to tell
Urgent my confidant, share and burden feather light.
​
I sit with details of coffin silver handles
And flowers that will lie, as body might
Sprawled, cascading, perfume hiding
Truth opaque, below and soon to soil
Hands on shoulder, touch and sighs of lengthy sorrow.
​
Mountainous recount, the awfulness
Of finding not life, but still shape
On carpet red, and we required to stand back
And interpret all, life art, as sculpture
Not final line of stroke, silence beating rhythm.
​
I want the sun to sink low, rays that bow to this
As does the blackness of night
Engulf me, sundial of death shadow
Waves to roar with tidal tears and clouds to cry
Drenching us, we, cycle on repeat.
​
Soon ripples fade, ash as grains no movement make
Dry face with sobbing heart and line of smile
As appropriate, but not for where you are
Where are you, my friend with need to tell
I lie on ground to share one beating heart.
​
So much to tell with service black, and black was
Tea and biscuits after, for words too hard for some
I dial your number, fingers weary
And silence greets with nothing
Is that it my brother? Is end so blatant neat?
​
If I found you, essence stretching infinite vast
And shining star that mocks all logic
I doubt such concept can reason, should reason
Such fantasy as comfort
Given things considered, now and after.
​
So much to speak, but turn I did, and words were ready
Finding only void and black
Of anguish, sorrow, hurt and pain exquisite
Where did you go brother love and what are you?
I sit in silence, you as quiet fading, confidant gone.

After the Winter by Claude McKay,Claude McKay,"'After the Winter' by Claude McKay is a beautiful and simple piece of poetry about an idealized fugue on the “summer isle” away from winter. The speaker spends the first stanza initiating his dream and suggesting that when winter is over, they're going to be able to “turn” their faces toward the summer isle and forget about the cold, inhospitable past. When they go towards the summer isle, they'll find peace. There will be everything that one could hope to find in the natural world. This includes rivers, flowers, cotton trees, and more. The poet uses personification to depict these scenes as well as good examples of imagery.","Some day, when trees have shed their leaves
And against the morning’s white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
Have sheltered for the night,
We’ll turn our faces southward, love,
Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
And wide-mouthed orchids smile.
And we will seek the quiet hill
Where towers the cotton tree,
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
And works the droning bee.
And we will build a cottage there
Beside an open glade,
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,
And ferns that never fade.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52818/after-the-winter
Recital by John Updike,John Updike,"In 'Recital', John Updike praises Roger Bobo's tuba playing skills and describes his popularity across the globe. In this poem, Updike uses lyrical words to maintain a dynamic flow that depicts the sharp, masterful “oompahs” of tuba. According to the speaker, everybody, regardless of their social status or their place of residence, appreciates Bobo's mastery of tuba playing. One who listens to his recital instantly gets awestruck by his quick cascading tone. Bobo knows his art, and he is always confident of winning listeners' hearts. That's why, the speaker says with conviction, “Nobody can oompah on tuba like Roger Bubo.”","Eskimos in Manitoba,
Barracuda off Aruba,
Cock an ear when Roger Bobo
Starts to solo on the tuba.
Men of every station -- Pooh-Bah,
Nabob, bozo, toff, and hobo --
Cry in unison, ""Indubi-
Tably, there is simply nobo-
Dy who oompahs on the tubo,
Solo, quite like Roger Bubo!""",http://www.edstephan.org/webstuff/poetry/Updike-Recital.html
In Romney Marsh by John Davidson,John Davidson,"In Romney Marsh is a landscape poem written at a time where landscape poems were considered to be a little bit out of fashion – in most areas, Romanticism had already faded, lending the poem itself a dated feel to it; although it was written much later than 1857, it still feels like a Romantic poem, and therefore feels like it should have been written much earlier. In the poem, the poet describes, in great and loving detail, his love for the place Romney Marsh, with a particular reverence given to the beauty and the placement of Romney Marsh, and with a familiarity that makes the poem read almost like a love poem. Wordsworth is still, perhaps, the better-known landscape poet, the one who has written ditties to nature and particularly to man's influence on nature, but a Wordsworthian poem is always slightly removed from the reality of the situation. In Romney Marsh does not have this problem: the love the poet has for it is a visible and obvious love that lasts despite the place's flaws, and influence on other things. It is particularly important to read knowing that it is still an area of beauty that exists, and is safeguarded by the British government, though its purpose has changed ever since the switch from sheep farming to arable production. That being said, a lot of British landscape poems betray a familiarity to the area that is almost loving, and this is certainly true of Romney Marsh. It is easy to believe that he has grown up there, despite the fact that John Davidson is a Scottish poet.","As I went down to Dymchurch Wall,
I heard the South sing o'er the land
I saw the yellow sunlight fall
On knolls where Norman churches stand.

And ringing shrilly, taut and lithe,
Within the wind a core of sound,
The wire from Romney town to Hythe
Along its airy journey wound.

A veil of purple vapour flowed
And trailed its fringe along the Straits;
The upper air like sapphire glowed:
And roses filled Heaven's central gates.


Masts in the offing wagged their tops;
The swinging waves pealed on the shore;
The saffron beach, all diamond drops
And beads of surge, prolonged the roar.

As I came up from Dymchurch Wall,
I saw above the Downs' low crest
The crimson brands of sunset fall,
Flicker and fade from out the West.

Night sank: like flakes of silver fire
The stars in one great shower came down;
Shrill blew the wind; and shrill the wire
Rang out from Hythe to Romney town.

The darkly shining salt sea drops
Streamed as the waves clashed on the shore;
The beach, with all its organ stops
Pealing again, prolonged the roar.",https://genius.com/John-davidson-in-romney-marsh-annotated
Porridge by Spike Milligan,Spike Milligan,"'Porridge' by Spike Milligan is a light-hearted children's poem that speaks on the great value and contributions of porridge. In the first lines of 'Porridge', the speaker begins by asking why porridge, such an important food to the British people, does not have a monument. This is asked by the speaker without sarcasm but was written by Milligan with the intention of provoking laughter or general amusement. Through the next lines, the speaker tries to outline why porridge deserves a monument and then envisions what that monument would look like after completion. He thinks it should be on a plinth in London, but that the “Porridge” should be made in Scotland.","Why is there no monument
To Porridge in our land?
If it's good enough to eat,
It's good enough to stand!

On a plinth in London
A statue we should see
Of Porridge made in Scotland
Signed, ""Oatmeal, O.B.E.""

Afternoon on a Hill by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"'Afternoon on a Hill' by Edna St. Vincent Millay is a simple poem about a speaker's plans for an afternoon on a hill in the sun, surrounded by flowers. This poem is quite straightforward. It takes the reader into the future where the speaker plans to spend time alone on a hill, surrounded by hundreds of flowers. She's not going to pick them, but she is going to touch them. She'll savor the moment while it's occurring but not do anything to persevere it longer than it naturally lasts. At the end of the afternoon, when the sun has gone down and she's looking out over the lights of the town, she'll pick out her home among them and head down to it.","I will be the gladdest thing
Under the sun!
I will touch a hundred flowers
And not pick one.
I will look at cliffs and clouds
With quiet eyes,
Watch the wind bow down the grass,
And the grass rise.
And when lights begin to show
Up from the town,
I will mark which must be mine,
And then start down!",https://poets.org/poem/afternoon-hill
Your One Good Dress by Brenda Shaughnessy,Brenda Shaughnessy,"'Your One Good Dress' by Brenda Shaughnessy is an interesting depiction of how dresses represent one's intentions and attitude. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker goes through all the reasons why one dress or another is the incorrect choice. After dismissing ballroom gowns, red, brown, and olive ones, they land on a black dress as the right choice. It's the only one “you” can wear to a funeral, party, reunion, or when you decide to go missing.","Myself I'm like a dress my mother made
me, a fabric self split open with a sigh
as I grew and—bewildered or proud
 
or full of rage—patched with nicer
material than we'd had before. I got
the sense it was all wasted on me.
 
But a needle's sharp to pierce, is itself
pierced—so as to sew like I was taught.
Like I learned: no dress could ever be
 
beautiful or best if it had me in it.
I was the stain in a place we couldn't fix.
Having fallen on a slicer of some kind.
 
Double-seamed, scabbed over, a new body
pocket in the pattern. How to stitch up
that wound right into the clean vertical rip
 
in some on-sale flannelette?
I'd never again be cold. Skin's holey not holy.
In mad winter alone with drink, I think:
 
tattoo needles don't use thread but ink
to mark a place in this ever-moving skin
and that wound is ornament. But who
 
needs a mark to know what's marked?
I would pray to the dark in the dark.
But what did I ask for, what did I know
 
to ask for? Nonfatal wounds: they're there
when we die, deliquescent, vibrating like a drum
skin just after each beat moves off.
 
A part of music. A way a body keeps time,
is time's keeper, vigilant till time up and goes
to find another body. Another's warmth
 
and shelter. Or related injuries. Anyone
who hurts another was hurt that same way,
so how far back behind our backs do we go
 
to finally find the first hurt; whose finger
points to say, ""You! You're the one who god
knows why started a cycle of unending pain,""
 
to someone's child in short pants?
A baby just torn a hole in her amnion swirl?
And what of me? I can't tell where my flesh
 
meets the rest of me, ragbag full of rags,
shot full of holes but that's just the way cotton
and silk and everything I said up till now looks
 
when it hits the air and is cried on. I'm so inside
out I evaporated entirely already as August does,
my actual dress shredded at the seams—
 
unsalvageable. Who would ever love me like this?
And just like that, I stopped thinking about it.
I agree to meet you at the ferry heading to a place
 
neither of us wants to go but both just said
sure, I'll go... if you want! We should turn back,
nobody said. Oh we should before it's too late,
 
nobody said again, insistent this time.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/91497/dress-form
The Rainbow by Walter De La Mare,Walter de la Mare,"The Rainbow' by Walter de la Mare depicts a “lovely arch / Of rainbow” the speaker saw in the sky. He expresses his wonder at the sight of the colours in the sky. It arched over the sky in a magnificent and awe-inspiring way. He was drawn in to stare at it until it was no longer there. The poet also speaks of the other elements that surround the rainbow–the passing rain and the burning sun. The scene was perfect for its appearance in the sky. The rainbow was a temporary beauty, there one minute and gone the next. He experiences its presence as a brief gift amongst the “solitude” of the wet foliage around him. ","I saw the lovely arch
Of Rainbow span the sky,
The gold sun burning
As the rain swept by.
In bright-ringed solitude
The showery foliage shone
One lovely moment,
And the Bow was gone.",yourdailypoem.com/listpoem.jsp?poem_id=3817
Poem in October by Dylan Thomas,Dylan Thomas,"Poem in October' by Dylan Thomas tells of a speaker's journey out of autumn and up a hill to reclaim childhood joy, the summer season, and his spirituality. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he was thirty years old when he wrote this. It was his birthday and he chose to go on a walk. He left his home, traveled alongside the water's edge, listened to the seabirds and the woods. The speaker left the town behind and began a climb up a nearby hill. As he rose the town shrank. At the same time, the season began to change. Autumn, and it's cool air, faded away and the summer returned. The rain continued as he climbed, as did the presence of birds. These two images are crucial to the speaker's understanding of happiness and childhood. When he finally got to the top of the hill it was like he had reached heaven. He was far above the coolness of autumn and he became absorbed with memories of his childhood. The speaker recalled coming to his place with his mother and what it meant to him. He hoped while on the hill that the joy he experienced will last throughout the year. Perhaps he will return to reclaim it when he turns thirty-one.","It was my thirtieth year to heaven
Woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood
And the mussel pooled and the heron
Priested shore
The morning beckon
With water praying and call of seagull and rook
And the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall
Myself to set foot
That second
In the still sleeping town and set forth.
My birthday began with the water-
Birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name
Above the farms and the white horses
And I rose
In rainy autumn
And walked abroad in a shower of all my days.
High tide and the heron dived when I took the road
Over the border
And the gates
Of the town closed as the town awoke.
A springful of larks in a rolling
Cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling
Blackbirds and the sun of October
Summery
On the hill's shoulder,
Here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly
Come in the morning where I wandered and listened
To the rain wringing
Wind blow cold
In the wood faraway under me.
Pale rain over the dwindling harbour
And over the sea wet church the size of a snail
With its horns through mist and the castle
Brown as owls
But all the gardens
Of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales
Beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.
There could I marvel
My birthday
Away but the weather turned around.
It turned away from the blithe country
And down the other air and the blue altered sky
Streamed again a wonder of summer
With apples
Pears and red currants
And I saw in the turning so clearly a child's
Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother
Through the parables
Of sun light
And the legends of the green chapels
And the twice told fields of infancy
That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.
These were the woods the river and sea
Where a boy
In the listening
Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy
To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide.
And the mystery
Sang alive
Still in the water and singingbirds.
And there could I marvel my birthday
Away but the weather turned around. And the true
Joy of the long dead child sang burning
In the sun.
It was my thirtieth
Year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon
Though the town below lay leaved with October blood.
O may my heart's truth
Still be sung
On this high hill in a year's turning.",https://allpoetry.com/Poem-in-October
A Winter Blue Jay by Sara Teasdale,Sara Teasdale,"A Winter Blue Jay' by Sara Teasdale tells of a perfect day in which the speaker and her companion find the pinnacle of their love, and then surpass it. The poem begins by placing the couple in a snow-covered landscape, walking through the “whisper[ing]” snow, enjoying a quiet moment. Their shadows are “danc[ing]” behind them, creating a beautiful pattern of light. It is clear that this moment is not one that comes often. They continue on their walk and come upon skaters on a frozen lake who gracefully, without fault, weave around one another. Their grace and effortless beauty mimic the day and improve upon it still. Finally, the speaker asks if they have reached the “highest point” of their happiness and she decides that they have not as her companion points out a bluejay. The jay is proud of it's own form and fearless in its assertions of life. The bird is like their love is that day, without worry for the future and enjoying the perfect moment the day has brought. The poem concludes with an optimistic statement about happiness. That when one believes they have reached the pinnacle of their life, in which nothing could increase their joy, there may be more around the corner waiting for them.","Crisply the bright snow whispered,
Crunching beneath our feet;
Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
Our shadows danced,
Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
Across the lake the skaters
Flew to and fro,
With sharp turns weaving
A frail invisible net.
In ecstasy the earth
Drank the silver sunlight;
In ecstasy the skaters
Drank the wine of speed;
In ecstasy we laughed
Drinking the wine of love.
Had not the music of our joy
Sounded its highest note?
But no,
For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
“Oh look!”
There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
Fearless and gay as our love,
A bluejay cocked his crest!
Oh who can tell the range of joy
Or set the bounds of beauty?",https://poets.org/poem/winter-blue-jay
Moonlight by Sara Teasdale,Sara Teasdale,"'Moonlight' by Sara Teasdale is a poem about the sorrows of youth and the blissful nature of old age. This lyrical poem starts with the speaker longing for old age. This is because the speaker believes that youth is full of pain and misery. They believe that this pain and misery arises out of happiness, and that they are two sides of the same coin. Old age, on the other hand, is sad and cold by itself, and there is no happiness to speak of. This is why the pain and misery that so affects youth does not have any impact on old age.","It will not hurt me when I am old,
A running tide where moonlight burned
Will not sting me like silver snakes;
The years will make me sad and cold,
It is the happy heart that breaks.
The heart asks more than life can give,
When that is learned, then all is learned;
The waves break fold on jewelled fold,
But beauty itself is fugitive,
It will not hurt me when I am old.",https://poets.org/poem/moonlight
Theme for English B by Langston Hughes,Langston Hughes,"Theme for English B' by Langston Hughes explores the mind of a young black man, setting out to write an assignment for his English class. The poem describes the assignment, one page of writing, and the speaker's apprehension about completing it. He isn't sure that he's going to be able to simply sit down and write. He is sure that it's more complicated than that. His apprehension turns into success as he mulls over his feelings and explores his personality and heritage. He speaks on his similarities to his classmates and his differences, as well as his relationship with the white instructor.","The instructor said,
Go home and write
a page tonight.
And let that page come out of you—
Then, it will be true.
I wonder if it’s that simple?
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem. I went to school there, then Durham, then here to this college on the hill above Harlem. I am the only colored student in my class. The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem, through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas, Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y, the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator up to my room, sit down, and write this page:
It’s not easy to know what is true for you or me at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I’m what
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page. (I hear New York, too.) Me—who?
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love. I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.
I guess being colored doesn’t make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races. So will my page be colored that I write? Being me, it will not be white.
But it will be
a part of you, instructor.
You are white—
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
That’s American.
Sometimes perhaps you don’t want to be a part of me. Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
But we are, that’s true!
As I learn from you,
I guess you learn from me—
although you’re older—and white—
and somewhat more free.

The Retreat by Henry Vaughan,Henry Vaughan,"'The Retreat' by Henry Vaughan describes a speaker's desire to escape to the past where he was a younger, purer, and generally happier human being. The poem begins with the speaker mourning for the lost days of his childhood. He longs to return to a time when he was in his “angel infancy” and had yet to be influenced by the dark forces of the world. It would be a time in which he had yet to stray far from his home or realize the struggle that would take him over internally. In the present day, he worries about his own emotions and his sinful nature. He is concerned over his own being in a way that was not even considered when he was young. In the final lines, the speaker describes the end of his life and how he will return to the dust of the earth. This will be the penultimate ending for a man who longs for his previous life.","Happy those early days! when I
Shined in my angel infancy.
Before I understood this place
Appointed for my second race,
Or taught my soul to fancy aught
But a white, celestial thought;
When yet I had not walked above
A mile or two from my first love,
And looking back, at that short space,
Could see a glimpse of His bright face;
When on some gilded cloud or flower
My gazing soul would dwell an hour,
And in those weaker glories spy
Some shadows of eternity;
Before I taught my tongue to wound
My conscience with a sinful sound,
Or had the black art to dispense
A several sin to every sense,
But felt through all this fleshly dress
Bright shoots of everlastingness.
O, how I long to travel back,
And tread again that ancient track!
That I might once more reach that plain
Where first I left my glorious train,
From whence th’ enlightened spirit sees
That shady city of palm trees.
But, ah! my soul with too much stay
Is drunk, and staggers in the way.
Some men a forward motion love;
But I by backward steps would move,
And when this dust falls to the urn,
In that state I came, return.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45430/the-retreat-56d2250b6cff5
My Last Duchess by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,"'My Last Duchess' by Robert Browning is a chilling poem about the value of women in a duke's life. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker tells the reader that an emissary is visiting who is trying to negotiate a new marriage for the Duke. He also describes how he was recently married, inspired by a portrait of his late wife. He suggests that she did something he didn't approve of and that her behavior displeased him. Finally, the Duchess died and now the Duke is left to choose a new bride.","That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
“Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
But to myself they turned (since none puts by
The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
How such a glance came there; so, not the first
Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not
Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
Must never hope to reproduce the faint
Half-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff
Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
For calling up that spot of joy. She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,
The dropping of the daylight in the West,
The bough of cherries some officious fool
Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
She rode with round the terrace—all and each
Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
Or blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked
Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame
This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
In speech—which I have not—to make your will
Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this
Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let
Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—
E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose
Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without
Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet
The company below, then. I repeat,
The Count your master’s known munificence
Is ample warrant that no just pretense
Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed
At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go
Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43768/my-last-duchess
Carol by Kenneth Grahame,Kenneth Grahame,"Carol' by Kenneth Grahame is a beautiful Christmas carol that retells the story of Christ's nativity. The poem is set at night, a few hours before Christ's birth. The poem begins with a request to the villagers to keep their doors open to welcome those who are standing outside in the “frosty tide”. The speaker of the poem depicts their condition. They are standing in the cold and waiting to enter one of the houses. There is a sense of waiting in everyone's tone as something great is going to happen in the morning. Thereafter, the poet quickly shifts to the story of Joseph and Mary. After being tired of walking, they entered into a thatch. It is that holy but lowly stable where Christ was born at the stroke of daybreak on 25th December.","Villagers all, this frosty tide,
Let your doors swing open wide,
Though wind may follow, and snow beside,
Yet draw us in by your fire to bide;
Joy shall be yours in the morning!
Here we stand in the cold and the sleet,
Blowing fingers and stamping feet,
Come from far away you to greet —
You by the fire and we in the street —
Bidding you joy in the morning!
For ere one half of the night was gone,
Sudden a star has led us on,
Raining bliss and benison —
Bliss tomorrow and more anon,
Joy for every morning!
Goodman Joseph toiled through the snow —
Saw the star o'er a stable low;
Mary she might not further go —
Welcome thatch, and litter below!
Joy was hers in the morning!
And then they heard the angels tell,
""Who were the first to cry Nowell?
Animals all, as it befell,
In the stable where they did dwell!
Joy shall be theirs in the morning!""",https://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Poetry/carol2.htm
O let the solid ground by Alfred Lord Tennyson,Alfred Lord Tennyson,"O let the solid ground' by Alfred Lord Tennyson is a short pronouncement of a speaker's intention to find love before Heaven takes his life. The poem expresses a speaker's desire to find someone who truly loves him before he loses his life or goes mad. He states that he's willing to endure anything as long as he gets to have the “sweet” experience that others have before him. The tone throughout the poem is concise and determined, helping Tennyson craft a hopeful and at times desperate mood. 'O let the solid ground' speaks on themes of love, the purpose of life, and loss.","O let the solid ground
Not fail beneath my feet
Before my life has found
What some have found so sweet!
Then let come what come may,
What matter if I go mad,
I shall have had my day.

Let the sweet heavens endure,
Not close and darken above me
Before I am quite quite sure
That there is one to love me!
Then let come what come may
To a life that has been so sad,
I shall have had my day.",https://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=15684
The Negro Mother by Langston Hughes,Langston Hughes,"For anyone with any knowledge of American history, the title of this poem alone, The Negro Mother, evokes emotion. The African American slaves lived through the worst brutality known to have taken place on American soil. The Negro Mother, although written by Langston Hughes, a man, comes to readers through the voice of a woman and a former slave. She writes to her children, challenging them to pick up the torch and to carry it on, fighting for freedom and equality. Her words paint the image of a strong and passionate black woman who has been abused and mistreated, but who has not succumbed to oppression but has risen above it with a passion in her heart and a song in her mouth. These are the words she wants every black child in America to take to heart.","Children, I come back today
To tell you a story of the long dark way
That I had to climb, that I had to know
In order that the race might live and grow.
Look at my face - dark as the night -
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.
I am the woman who worked in the field
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.
I am the one who labored as a slave,
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave -
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.

Three hundred years in the deepest South:
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.
God put a dream like steel in my soul.
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.

Now, through my children, young and free,
I realized the blessing deed to me.
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.
I had nothing, back there in the night.
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,
But I had to keep on till my work was done:
I had to keep on! No stopping for me -
I was the seed of the coming Free.
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother
Deep in my breast - the Negro mother.
I had only hope then, but now through you,
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:
All you dark children in the world out there,
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow -
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.
Make of my pass a road to the light
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.
Lift high my banner out of the dust.
Stand like free men supporting my trust.
Believe in the right, let none push you back.
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife
Still bar you the way, and deny you life -
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers
Impel you forever up the great stairs -
For I will be with you till no white brother
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-negro-mother/
November Graveyard by Sylvia Plath,Sylvia Plath,"November Graveyard' by Sylvia Plath describes the nature of a cemetery in November and how there is nothing present in the land beyond the physical. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the cemetery is full of trees and grasses which are unwilling to shed their summer leaves and colours. They cling desperately and uselessly to their foliage. Just as the plants attempt to maintain life into the winter, so too does humanity seek something after death. The next two stanzas are used to explain, in impassioned detail, that there is nothing magical about the cemetery. It is clear by the end of the poem that the speaker is set in her opinion about the land. She feels it is only relevant for its physical and “essential “parts.","The scene stands stubborn: skinflint trees
Hoard last year's leaves, won't mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn
To elegiac dryads, and dour grass
Guards the hard-hearted emerald of its grassiness
However the grandiloquent mind may scorn
Such poverty. No dead men's cries
Flower forget-me-nots between the stones
Paving this grave ground. Here's honest rot
To unpick the heart, pare bone
Free of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton
Bulks real, all saints' tongues fall quiet:
Flies watch no resurrections in the sun.
At the essential landscape stare, stare
Till your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind:
Whatever lost ghosts flare,
Damned, howling in their shrouds across the moor
Rave on the leash of the starving mind
Which peoples the bare room, the blank, untenanted air.",https://neuroticpoets.com/plath/poem/graveyard
Morning Land by George Essex Evans,George Essex Evans,"'Morning Land' by George Essex Evans describes the trials and hardships associated with reaching a new land, as well as the new hopes and dreams that can be achieved after one scales all obstacles. This piece begins by describing the world that the men in the poem are going to be attempting to leave. The world is “dull grey mist” and the “sullen roar of the sea.” There is nothing there but the reminders of all the tragedies and failures of the past. All are seeking to rise above it. Also described is, “Morning Land.” A metaphorical utopia that is the breeding ground for “rest and love” and “hope for brain and hand.” This world represents the grass that is always greener on the other side and the human desire to improve one's circumstances. The poem continues and the reader gets additional detail about how difficult this climb up the mountainside is. Many fall to their deaths, only to be replaced by others just as eager. No one is deterred by critics and cowards, they climb onward. Additionally, these men climbing are forging a path for others to follow so that all may reach this utopia out of the reach of strife.","Around and beneath, the dull grey mist and the sullen roar of the sea,
Scant footing-place on the sheer cliffs face—with death for a penalty;
But afar and above there is rest and love, there is hope for brain and hand,
The valleys fair and the crystal air and the peaks of Morning Land.

Around and beneath are the mists of toil and the sullen roar of the world,
And the sneer of scorn for a foothold gone and a climber backward hurled;
But afar and above are the hopes of men with the heart and will to stand
On the thin rift’s edge and the slippery ledge that lead to Morning Land.

They slip and fall from the sheer cliffs face; ah, God! they are falling still!
But another leaps for the vacant place, and another his place will fill.
’Tis little they fear the coward’s sneer, or the scorn of a selfish band,
Whose eyes are set on the parapet and the heights of Morning Land.

Hark to the ring as their rock picks swing, and bite for a foothold there!
Grip by grip they are straining up that others may travel fair.
The world will follow them all some day, the men it has shunned and banned,
The gallant hearts that hewed the way that leads to Morning Land.",https://allpoetry.com/Morning-Land
Sonnet 109 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'Sonnet 109' by William Shakespeare is a devotional sonnet written to the speaker's “rose,” the Fair Youth. In the first lines of 'Sonnet 109,' the speaker begins by trying to remind the youth, and anyone listening, that his love for the former has never cooled. Even if the two are separated, he knows that nothing could temper the love he has for this young man. He compares himself through a simile to a traveler who always comes home. His nature is not that which would allow him to abandon the Youth for any other pleasures. Because he concludes, there is nothing else in the world worth loving for spending time on.","O! never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
That is my home of love; if I have ranged,
Like him that travels, I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stained,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/50301/sonnet-109-o-never-say-that-i-was-false-of-heart
Water by Ralph Waldo Emerson,Ralph Waldo Emerson,"'Water' by Ralph Waldo Emerson discusses the power, beauty, and potential of water, as well as its ability to destroy that which ill uses it. The poem depicts water as a personified element that has learned, through its long life, how to navigate the world. It knows civilization well. Water is at once “witty” and “pretty.” It blesses those who use it well and treats poorly those who misuse it.","The water understands
Civilization well;
It wets my foot, but prettily,
It chills my life, but wittily,
It is not disconcerted,
It is not broken-hearted:
Well used, it decketh joy,
Adorneth, doubleth joy:
Ill used, it will destroy,
In perfect time and measure
With a face of golden pleasure
Elegantly destroy.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52342/water-56d230b9c319
When Great Trees Fall by Maya Angelou,Maya Angelou,"'When Great Trees Fall' by Maya Angelou is a moving poem that discusses the impact lost loved ones have on the living. In the first lines, the speaker begins by using an extended metaphor to describe a natural scene. She speaks about the reaction of animals when “great trees fall”. They hide, hunker down, and “lumber after safety”. The metaphor compares the death of loved ones to the monumental shifts that occur when large and powerful trees fall in the forest. As the poem progresses she moves on to directly speak about “great souls” and how human beings react to loss. The third stanza discusses one's inability to breathe and the sharpening one's memory undergoes. The poem concludes with a message of hope and renewal, suggesting that after a loved one's death that “We can be…better. For they existed”.","When great trees fall,
rocks on distant hills shudder,
lions hunker down
in tall grasses,
and even elephants
lumber after safety.
When great trees fall
in forests,
small things recoil into silence,
their senses
eroded beyond fear.
When great souls die,
the air around us becomes
light, rare, sterile.
We breathe, briefly.
Our eyes, briefly,
see with
a hurtful clarity.
Our memory, suddenly sharpened,
examines,
gnaws on kind words
unsaid,
promised walks
never taken.
Great souls die and
our reality, bound to
them, takes leave of us.
Our souls,
dependent upon their
nurture,
now shrink, wizened.
Our minds, formed
and informed by their
radiance, fall away.
We are not so much maddened
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance of
dark, cold
caves.
And when great souls die,
after a period peace blooms,
slowly and always
irregularly. Spaces fill
with a kind of
soothing electric vibration.
Our senses, restored, never
to be the same, whisper to us.
They existed. They existed.
We can be. Be and be
better. For they existed.",https://poems.com/poem/when-great-trees-fall/
And There Was a Great Calm by Thomas Hardy,Thomas Hardy,"'And There Was a Great Calm' by Thomas Hardy describes the horrors of WWI, the end of the war, and the “Great Calm” which came on November 11th, 1918. The poem begins with the speaker describing all the years of emotion which have impacted the peoples of the world. There has been much anger, fury, despair and passion amongst those fighting and those “feeble folk” who are at home but still immersed in the war. No one has been able to escape it. The men on the battlefields have truly suffered, so much so that when the war is declared over, no one can quite believe it. The speaker describes the men walking away from their posts and marveling at the silence that surrounds them. The calm brings with it a new hope the world has finally changed and all people will be able to return to the lives they once had.","There had been years of Passion—scorching, cold,
And much Despair, and Anger heaving high,
Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold,
Among the young, among the weak and old,
And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?”
 
 
Men had not paused to answer. Foes distraught
Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness,
Philosophies that sages long had taught,
And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought,
And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness.
 
 
The feeble folk at home had grown full-used
To 'dug-outs', 'snipers', 'Huns', from the war-adept
In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused;
To day-dreamt men in millions, when they mused—
To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.
 
 
Waking to wish existence timeless, null,
Sirius they watched above where armies fell;
He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull
Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull
Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well.
 
 
So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
Were dead and damned, there sounded 'War is done!'
One morrow. Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,
'Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly,
And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?'
 
 
Breathless they paused. Out there men raised their glance
To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped,
As they had raised it through the four years’ dance
Of Death in the now familiar flats of France;
And murmured, 'Strange, this! How? All firing stopped?'
 
 
Aye; all was hushed. The about-to-fire fired not,
The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song.
One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot
And turned. The Spirit of Irony smirked out, 'What?
Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?'
 
 
Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray,
No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn,
No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray;
Worn horses mused: 'We are not whipped to-day;'
No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn.
 
 
Calm fell. From Heaven distilled a clemency;
There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky;
Some could, some could not, shake off misery:
The Sinister Spirit sneered: 'It had to be!'
And again the Spirit of Pity whispered, 'Why?'",poetryfoundation.org/poems/57336/and-there-was-a-great-calm
Immigrant Blues by Li-Young Lee,Li-Young Lee,"Immigrant Blues' by Li-Young Lee describes an immigrant's bewilderment with the idea of internalizing a second language other than their own. The poem begins with a hint of a story that the speaker's father used to tell him while teaching him the importance of learning a “second tongue.” He recounts how he has been chased to death since his birth. The same old story repeats in the speaker's life when he tries to teach one of his sons the “second tongue,” a reference to the English language. The speaker chooses non-fictional titles for their personal tales in order to include the experiences of those who had to immigrate to a new country. “Survival Strategies and the Melancholy of Racial Assimilation” and “Patterns of Love in Peoples of Diaspora” are some of the titles he uses to talk about immigrant experiences, such as internalizing an alien language, sense of disconnection, and inner mutism.","People have been trying to kill me since I was born,
a man tells his son, trying to explain
the wisdom of learning a second tongue.
It’s an old story from the previous century
about my father and me.
The same old story from yesterday morning
about me and my son.
It’s called “Survival Strategies
and the Melancholy of Racial Assimilation.”
It’s called “Psychological Paradigms of Displaced Persons,”
called “The Child Who’d Rather Play than Study.”
Practice until you feel
the language inside you, says the man.
But what does he know about inside and outside,
my father who was spared nothing
in spite of the languages he used?
And me, confused about the flesh and the soul,
who asked once into a telephone,
Am I inside you?
You’re always inside me, a woman answered,
at peace with the body’s finitude,
at peace with the soul’s disregard
of space and time.
Am I inside you? I asked once
lying between her legs, confused
about the body and the heart.
If you don’t believe you’re inside me, you’re not,
she answered, at peace with the body’s greed,
at peace with the heart’s bewilderment.
It’s an ancient story from yesterday evening
called “Patterns of Love in Peoples of Diaspora,”
called “Loss of the Homeplace
and the Defilement of the Beloved,”
called “I want to Sing but I Don’t Know Any Songs.”",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52210/immigrant-blue
Look We Have Coming to Dover! by Daljit Nagra,Daljit Nagra,"'Look We Have Coming to Dover!' by Daljit Nagra tells of the arrival of immigrants to England and of their lives filled with hard work, fears, and dreams. The poem begins with the speaker describing the terrifying arrival into Dover There is nothing beautiful about this scene. The water is dirty, the tourists lord over them and they fear being spotted. When they finally make it to shore they drive off in an inconspicuous van and try to make lives for themselves. These are hard lives, filled with endless work and the ever-present fear that they're going to be caught and returned to their home country. At the same time, they are able to hope for a better future, as described in the final stanza.","So various, so beautiful, so new...'
- Matthew Arnold, 'Dover Beach'

Stowed in the sea to invade
the alfresco lash of a diesel-breeze
ratcheting speed into the tide, brunt with
gobfuls of surf phlegmed by cushy come-and-go
tourists prow'd on the cruisers, lording the ministered waves.

Seagull and shoal life
vexing their blarnies upon our huddled
camouflage past the vast crumble of scummed
cliffs, scramming on mulch as thunder unbladders
yobbish rain and wind on our escape hutched in a Bedford van.

Seasons or years we reap
inland, unclocked by the national eye
or stabs in the back, teemed for breathing
sweeps of grass through the whistling asthma of parks,
burdened, ennobled - poling sparks across pylon and pylon.

Swarms of us, grafting in
the black within shot of the moon's
spotlight, banking on the miracle of sun -
span its rainbow, passport us to life. Only then
can it be human to hoick ourselves, bare-faced for the clear.

Imagine my love and I,
our sundry others, Blair'd in the cash
of our beeswax'd cars, our crash clothes, free,
we raise our charged glasses over unparasol'd tables
East, babbling our lingoes, flecked by the chalk of Britannia!",https://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/look-we-have-coming-to-dover
The Perfect World by Kahlil Gibran,Kahlil Gibran,"The Perfect World' by Kahlil Gibran describes what a speaker sees as an ideal way to live in order to take advantage of all that God has created, and thereby craft a perfect world. The poem begins with the speaker asking God, the protector of lost souls to watch over him. He is concerned for his own destiny and wants to know why he was created. The speaker does not see himself as being able to attain the high levels of order and structure that appear in the following twenty or so lines. He begins by wondering over his own confused state and how he is supped to exist in-amongst those who have their whole lives figured. He sees the rest of the world as being made up of people who know what to feel, where they're going, and how they're going to get there. In contrast, his thoughts are confused and his emotions unpredictable. As the poem progresses the speaker lays out an impossible standard of life. A perfect world, he believes, would be created if all people were always their best selves, worshiped God perfectly, and lived without conflict. By the end of the text, he has become somewhat desperate and perhaps depressed as he attempts to figure out how he can live as they do.","God of lost souls, thou who are lost amongst the gods, hear me:
 
Gentle Destiny that watchest over us, mad, wandering spirits, hear me:
 
I dwell in the midst of a perfect race, I the most imperfect.
 
I, a human chaos, a nebula of confused elements, I move amongst finished worlds—peoples of complete laws and pure order, whose thoughts are assorted, whose dreams are arranged, and whose visions are enrolled and registered.
 
Their virtues, O God, are measured, their sins are weighed, and even the countless things that pass in the dim twilight of neither sin nor virtue are recorded and catalogued.
 
Here days and night are divided into seasons of conduct and governed by rules of blameless accuracy.
 
To eat, to drink, to sleep, to cover one’s nudity, and then to be weary in due time.
 
To work, to play, to sing, to dance, and then to lie still when the clock strikes the hour.
 
To think thus, to feel thus much, and then to cease thinking and feeling when a certain star rises above yonder horizon.
 
To rob a neighbour with a smile, to bestow gifts with a graceful wave of the hand, to praise prudently, to blame cautiously, to destroy a sound with a word, to burn a body with a breath, and then to wash the hands when the day’s work is done.
 
To love according to an established order, to entertain one’s best self in a preconceived manner, to worship the gods becomingly, to intrigue the devils artfully—and then to forget all as though memory were dead.
 
To fancy with a motive, to contemplate with consideration, to be happy sweetly, to suffer nobly—and then to empty the cup so that tomorrow may fill it again.
 
All these things, O God, are conceived with forethought, born with determination, nursed with exactness, governed by rules, directed by reason, and then slain and buried after a prescribed method. And even their silent graves that lie within the human soul are marked and numbered.
 
It is a perfect world, a world of consummate excellence, a world of supreme wonders, the ripest fruit in God’s garden, the master-thought of the universe.
 
But why should I be here, O God, I a green seed of unfulfilled passion, a mad tempest that seeketh neither east nor west, a bewildered fragment from a burnt planet?
 
Why am I here, O God of lost souls, thou who art lost amongst the gods?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58724/the-perfect-world
Time does not bring relief; you all have lied by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"Time does not bring relief; you all have lied' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of an emotionally damaged woman, seeking relief from heartbreak. The poem begins with this speaker chastising her listeners for lying to her. They told her that any pain she feels, on account of a lost lover, would fade away in time. She is angry because this has not come close to happening. One can assume that a great deal of time has passed, and the speaker's emotions are just as strong as they were when the hurt was fresh. She describes how her longing for her lover is omnipresent. It comes to her in the rain and with tidal changes. In the second stanza, she tells of all the changes she sees going on in the world. The speaker is aware that time is passing around her, but it doesn't touch her inner world. The snow might be melting on the mountains and the leaves being turned into smoke on the road, but she is the same as always. The final lines describe how these emotions have impacted her. Now, no matter where she goes, even if its somewhere he never was, she is “stricken” with thoughts of him. He haunts her heart and mind, in every setting and situation.","Time does not bring relief; you all have lied Who told me time would ease me of my pain! I miss him in the weeping of the rain; I want him at the shrinking of the tide;
The old snows melt from every mountain-side, And last year’s leaves are smoke in every lane; But last year’s bitter loving must remain
Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide. There are a hundred places where I fear To go,—so with his memory they brim. And entering with relief some quiet place Where never fell his foot or shone his face I say, “There is no memory of him here!” And so stand stricken, so remembering him.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46464/time-does-not-bring-relief-you-all-have-lied
Reunion by Charles Wright,Charles Wright,"'Reunion' focuses on the author's relationship with his poetry, and what it means to him. 'Reunion' begins with the narrator stating that another day has separated itself from the days up ahead. The narrator then says that this day keeps a photograph of him in its pocket and that it wants to bring him (the narrator) into the past. The poem ends with the narrator explaining that he uses poetry to untie himself and disappear.","Already one day has detached itself from all the rest up ahead.
It has my photograph in its soft pocket.
It wants to carry my breath into the past in its bag of wind.
I write poems to untie myself, to do penance and disappear
Through the upper right-hand corner of things, to say grace.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49434/reunion-56d22b8494dbc
On the Horse and His Rider by John Bunyan,John Bunyan,On the Horse and His Rider' by John Bunyan is an interesting look at the ways that riders control horses and how external forces control riders. The poem compares the rider to his horse and takes the reader through several examples of different ways that men ride. There are those who much more careless with their lives and their horses than others are. They appear to care not whether they end up in the afterlife. The way the horse moves tells the onlooker a lot about the nature of the rider. A horse can also learn about their “guider” in this same way.,"There's one rides very sagely on the road,
Showing that he affects the gravest mode.
Another rides tantivy, or full trot,
To show much gravity he matters not.
Lo, here comes one amain, he rides full speed,
Hedge, ditch, nor miry bog, he doth not heed.
One claws it up-hill without stop or check,
Another down as if he'd break his neck.
Now every horse has his especial guider;
Then by his going you may know the rider.

Comparison.

Now let us turn our horse into a man,
His rider to a spirit, if we can.
Then let us, by the methods of the guider,
Tell every horse how he should know his rider.
Some go, as men, direct in a right way,
Nor are they suffered to go astray;
As with a bridle they are governed,
And kept from paths which lead unto the dead.
Now this good man has his especial guider,
Then by his going let him know his rider.
Some go as if they did not greatly care,
Whether of heaven or hell they should be heir.
The rein, it seems, is laid upon their neck,
They seem to go their way without a check.
Now this man too has his especial guider,
And by his going he may know his rider.
Some again run as if resolved to die,
Body and soul, to all eternity.
Good counsel they by no means can abide;
They'll have their course whatever them betide.
Now these poor men have their especial guider,
Were they not fools they soon might know their rider.
There's one makes head against all godliness,
Those too, that do profess it, he'll distress;
He'll taunt and flout if goodness doth appear,
And at its countenancers mock and jeer.
Now this man, too, has his especial guider,
And by his going he might know his rider.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/upon-the-horse-and-his-rider/
Catrin by Gillian Clarke,Gillian Clarke,"This poem, ‘Catrin’, displays the love and turmoil in the parent-child relationship. This particular poem centers around a conflict that seems to have escalated into fury rather quickly. Through her use of imagery, the speaker is able to convey feelings of love and affection along with the frustration of dealing with the conflict that inevitably arises between the parent and the child. At the beginning of the poem, the speaker reveals that the person to whom she speaks is a child, but she does not reveal her position immediately. Because the author is female, it is easy to assume that the speaker is the mother. For simplicity’s sake, this analysis will assume as such, and thereby refer to the speaker in the feminine form. However, it is entirely possible that the speaker was the father, in this case. The gender of the child in the poem is not implied until near the end of the poem. Based on the voice of the speaker and the short description of the child, it is most probable that ‘Catrin’ describes a conflict between a mother and daughter. The conflict itself remains unresolved by the end of the poem, but both the mother and the daughter are apparently changed. The intensity of the argument has moved them both, though the speaker does not reveal the specific changes that have taken place. By the end of the poem, the reader can clearly understand the rationale behind the mother’s side of the argument. Allowing the reader to see this rationale also allows him to enter into the feelings of the mother. Just like the mother, the reader is also unable to open the eyes of the child to the practical nature of the mother’s decision. Thus, the reader can enter into the mother’s feelings. The speaker uses concrete imagery to describe her love for the child. This also allows the reader to further understand the complexity of the relationship and the intensity of the conflict. Though the mother is clearly “right” by the end of the poem, she does not feel that she “won”. Rather, she feels as though she has lost something. The daughter, also, clearly feels that she has lost. Somehow, the intensity of this argument has changed both the mother and the daughter. It was clearly a marked turning point in their lives and relationship. Through the vivid description of this conflict, the speaker is able to portray the deep love and affection that a mother has for her child, a love that will drive her to protect and love her children even when the children do not want or understand the need for the protection. The mother continues to love and fight for the protection of her daughter even when the daughter fights against it, giving her a “defiant glare” that leaves the mother feeling that something between them has changed forever. The name of the poem reveals that this poem is, indeed, about her daughter, Catrin.","I can remember you, child,
As I stood in a hot, white
Room at the window watching
The people and cars taking
Turn at the traffic lights.
I can remember you, our first
Fierce confrontation, the tight
Red rope of love which we both
Fought over. It was a square
Environmental blank, disinfected
Of paintings or toys. I wrote
All over the walls with my
Words, coloured the clean squares
With the wild, tender circles
Of our struggle to become
Separate. We want, we shouted,
To be two, to be ourselves.

Neither won nor lost the struggle
In the glass tank clouded with feelings
Which changed us both. Still I am fighting
You off, as you stand there
With your straight, strong, long
Brown hair and your rosy,
Defiant glare, bringing up
From the heart’s pool that old rope,
Tightening about my life,
Trailing love and conflict,
As you ask may you skate
In the dark, for one more hour.",gillianclarke.co.uk/gc2017/catrin/
They Say My Verse is Sad by A.E. Housman,A. E. Housman,"'They Say My Verse is Sad' by A.E. Housman is a short poem about the poet's understanding of his own writing. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, Housman, begins by noting that others believe his verse is sad. He knows why, as it does its best to contend with universal themes important to all of humanity. It has a limited scope, though, something that adds to the general sadness of the endeavor. Despite this, he still writes for others. He isn't writing for himself. He doesn't take comfort in his own poetry. It's for those who are in more trouble than he is.","They say my verse is sad: no wonder;
Its narrow measure spans
Tears of eternity, and sorrow,
Not mine, but man's.

This is for all ill-treated fellows
Unforn and unbegot,
For them to read when they're in trouble",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/they-say-my-verse-sad-no-wonder
The Lorax by Dr. Seuss,Dr. Seuss,"‘The Lorax’ was published in 1971 and is one of Dr. Seuss’s most popular books. It follows the main character, the Lorax who speaks for the trees and stands up against environmental destruction. The creatures that Seuss created for this book are accompanied by numerous examples of nonsense language and imagery that is stereotypically Seussian. The illustrations are brightly colored and entertaining all on their own. Since its publication, the book has been aimed as one of teacher’s Top 100 Books for Children and ranked in the top of the best picture books ever published

Seuss stated that this book, of all those that he had written, was his favorite. He went on to describe how it allowed him to address both environmental and economic issues and express his exaggeration with the world. 

An interesting piece of trivia that goes along with The Lorax comes in the form of a follow-up publication written by Terri Birkett, who was part of a family-owned hardwood flooring company. The company put out the book as a “logging-friendly” perspective on the environment.","That was long, long ago
But each day since that day
I've sat here and worried
and worried away.
Through the years while my buildings
have fallen apart,
I've worried about it
with all my heart.

""But now,"" says the Once'Ler,
""Now that you’re here,
the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear.
UNLESS someone like you
cares a whole awful lot,
nothing is going to get better.
It's not.


""So...
Catch!"" Calls the Once'Ler.
He let's something fall.
""It's a Truffula seed.
It's the last one of all!
You're in charge of the last of the Truffle seeds.
And the Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.
Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care.
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.
Then the Lorax
and his friends
may come back.""",https://genius.com/Dr-seuss-the-lorax-excerpt-annotated
"Cartoon Physics, part 1 by Nick Flynn",Nick Flynn,"'Cartoon Physics, part 1' by Nick Flynn satirizes the science-defying laws of animation or cartoons kids are attracted to. Flynn begins his poem by referring to the expansion of the galaxy in silence. Far away in the outer world, galaxies are constantly at work. While the ten-year-olds are busy learning the concepts of “cartoon physics”. According to the law of cartoons, a man can draw a circle on a rock in order to pass through different dimensions. In some of the animation movies, realism is denied and everything is shown in a way that makes the speaker disturbed. He knows that the character can easily escape from a burning house or a drowning sheep using common sense. While he tries to be a hero there. Such unrealistic events are described in this piece for the sake of satirizing them.","Children under, say, ten, shouldn't know
that the universe is ever-expanding, inexorably pushing into the vacuum, galaxies
swallowed by galaxies, whole
solar systems collapsing, all of it
acted out in silence. At ten we are still learning
the rules of cartoon animation,
that if a man draws a door on a rock
only he can pass through it. Anyone else who tries
will crash into the rock. Ten-year-olds
should stick with burning houses, car wrecks, ships going down—earthbound, tangible
disasters, arenas
where they can be heroes. You can run
back into a burning house, sinking ships
have lifeboats, the trucks will come
with their ladders, if you jump
you will be saved. A child
places her hand on the roof of a schoolbus, & drives across a city of sand. She knows
the exact spot it will skid, at which point
the bridge will give, who will swim to safety
& who will be pulled under by sharks. She will learn
that if a man runs off the edge of a cliff
he will not fall
until he notices his mistake.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52422/cartoon-physics-part-1
The Plain Sense of Things by Wallace Stevens,Wallace Stevens,"'The Plain Sense of Things' by Wallace Stevens is a thoughtful and well-loved poem about creativity and imagination. The poem starts out with the speaker noting the time when one returns to the “plain sense of things.” It's after the colorful fall leaves are gone, and one's left with the barren time between autumn and winter. There, the speaker notes, all imagination seems to die. One is left with a silence that feels impenetrable and entirely uncreative. But, this period in which everything seems raw and uninteresting is also a time to reset and reconsider one's work. It is incredibly necessary to continue the creative process.","After the leaves have fallen, we return
To a plain sense of things. It is as if
We had come to an end of the imagination,
Inanimate in an inert savoir.

It is difficult even to choose the adjective
For this blank cold, this sadness without cause.
The great structure has become a minor house.
No turban walks across the lessened floors.

The greenhouse never so badly needed paint.
The chimney is fifty years old and slants to one side.
A fantastic effort has failed, a repetition
In a repetitiousness of men and flies.

Yet the absence of the imagination had
Itself to be imagined. The great pond,
The plain sense of it, without reflections, leaves,
Mud, water like dirty glass, expressing silence

Of a sort, silence of a rat come out to see,
The great pond and its waste of the lilies, all this
Had to be imagined as an inevitable knowledge,
Required, as a necessity requires.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/49420/the-plain-sense-of-things
Quarantine by Eavan Boland,Eavan Boland,"In short, 'Quarantine,' a poem by Eavan Boland, is about a man and his wife who are forced to leave their home because his wife has become ill with famine fever. In this poem, the couple leaves on a wintry night, walking in the frigid temperatures. The next morning, the husband and wife are found dead, of cold and hunger. From the way the couple was positioned, it was obvious that the man had succumbed first, dying with his wife's feet in his hands. He had perished trying to provide heat to his sick and suffering wife. This poem is not only a documentation of the horrors of the Irish Potato Famine, but it is also a love poem, showcasing that love is not always proven by what are considered to be traditional romantic gestures. ","In the worst hour of the worst season
of the worst year of a whole people
a man set out from the workhouse with his wife.
He was walking—they were both walking—north.
She was sick with famine fever and could not keep up.
He lifted her and put her on his back.
He walked like that west and west and north.
Until at nightfall under freezing stars they arrived.
In the morning they were both found dead.
Of cold. Of hunger. Of the toxins of a whole history.
But her feet were held against his breastbone.
The last heat of his flesh was his last gift to her.
Let no love poem ever come to this threshold.
There is no place here for the inexact
praise of the easy graces and sensuality of the body.
There is only time for this merciless inventory:
Their death together in the winter of 1847.
Also what they suffered. How they lived.
And what there is between a man and woman.
And in which darkness it can best be proved.",https://poets.org/poem/quarantine
Apologia Pro Poemate Meo by Wilfred Owen,Wilfred Owen,"'Apologia Pro Poemate Meo' is a poem about soldiers. Although the war is present, as in all other poetry by Wilfred Owen, it takes a back seat to the description and the liveliness of the soldiers; they are immortalized and made to live before the war brutalized them into insensible men. The Latin title translates to 'an apology on behalf of my poetry'. Although Owen was popularized in later days, at the time he was not considered to be an especially brilliant poet, and being against the war made him a fair few enemies in the pro-war ranks. However, Owen was also a soldier, and his view of camaraderie is very much felt in the lines of 'Apologia Pro Poemate Meo.' In a letter, he wrote to his mother, stating that 'you could not be visited by a band of friends half so fine as surround me here'.","I, too, saw God through mud—
The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.
War brought more glory to their eyes than blood,
And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child.
Merry it was to laugh there—
Where death becomes absurd and life absurder.
For power was on us as we slashed bones bare
Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder.
I, too, have dropped off fear—
Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,
And sailed my spirit surging, light and clear
Past the entanglement where hopes lay strewn;
And witnessed exultation—
Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl,
Shine and lift up with passion of oblation,
Seraphic for an hour; though they were foul. I have made fellowships—
Untold of happy lovers in old song.
For love is not the binding of fair lips
With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,
But Joy, whose ribbon slips,—
But wound with war’s hard wire whose stakes are strong;
Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong.
I have perceived much beauty
In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;
Heard music in the silentness of duty;
Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate.
Nevertheless, except you share
With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell,
Whose world is but the trembling of a flare,
And heaven but as the highway for a shell,
You shall not hear their mirth:
You shall not come to think them well content
By any jest of mine. These men are worth
Your tears: You are not worth their merriment.",https://poets.org/poem/apologia-pro-poemate-meo
The Emperor of Ice-Cream by Wallace Stevens,Wallace Stevens,"The Emperor of Ice-Cream' by Wallace Stevens speaks on one's inability to control death and ability to live a good life. The poem begins with the speaker asking that the listener fetch a strong man to roll cigarettes. There is some kind of celebration occurring. The celebratory atmosphere is lessened by the speaker who tells everyone to go on acting as they always have. There is no reason to stand on ceremony. By the time a reader gets to the second stanza, it becomes clear that the event in question is a woman's death. She will be put to rest just like everyone else who has ever lived. There is no way to escape death. ","Call the roller of big cigars,
The muscular one, and bid him whip
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.
Let the wenches dawdle in such dress
As they are used to wear, and let the boys
Bring flowers in last month's newspapers.
Let be be finale of seem.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.

Take from the dresser of deal,
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet
On which she embroidered fantails once
And spread it so as to cover her face.
If her horny feet protrude, they come
To show how cold she is, and dumb.
Let the lamp affix its beam.
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45234/the-emperor-of-ice-cream
Song of the Owl by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"'Song of the Owl' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is an onomatopoeic poem that describes the hooting of an owl. This poem progresses with the sound of an owl that is sitting somewhere in a tree. There is darkness all around. No other sound can be heard in the leaden darkness, except that of the shrill and transient sound of the bird. It is not an ordinary owl. According to the poetic persona, it is “the great black owl.” It seems as if the poet is hinting at something else by referring to this creature. It hoots, “Au” three times and suddenly a voice, probably that of the zoomorphic owl, calls, “Hi! a! haa!”","Ojibwa

To Caroline by Lord Byron,Lord Byron,"Most people wouldn’t think of the kind of man to embark on wildly flamboyant sexual affairs as being one to write expressive, beautiful poetry, but then, Lord George Gordon Byron (biography of Lord Byron) was a very contradictory man, one who could be wildly devoted to pursuing and courting a woman before quickly losing interest after she’d agreed to be with him. Byron’s work, ‘To Caroline’, provides the reader with insights into his very complicated and often troubled relationships with others. Despite the historic nature of the affair, the poem expresses deep sentiments and a strong sense of sorrow. It is an excellent means for assessing some of Lord Byron’s complex character, and a touching piece of poetry as well.","Think’st thou I saw thy beauteous eyes,
Suffus’d in tears, implore to stay;
And heard unmov’d thy plenteous sighs,
Which said far more than words can say?

Though keen the grief thy tears exprest,
When love and hope lay both o’erthrown;
Yet still, my girl, this bleeding breast
Throbb’d, with deep sorrow, as thine own.

But, when our cheeks with anguish glow’d,
When thy sweet lips were join’d to mine;
The tears that from my eyelids flow’d
Were lost in those which fell from thine.

Thou could’st not feel my burning cheek,
Thy gushing tears had quench’d its flame,
And, as thy tongue essay’d to speak,
In sighs alone it breath’d my name.

And yet, my girl, we weep in vain,
In vain our fate in sighs deplore;
Remembrance only can remain,
But that, will make us weep the more.

Again, thou best belov’d, adieu!
Ah! if thou canst, o’ercome regret,
Nor let thy mind past joys review,
Our only hope is, to forget!",https://www.poetryverse.com/lord-byron-poems/to-caroline
The Window by Diane di Prima,Diane di Prima,"'The Window' by Diane di Prima is a very subjective and ambiguous poem as it can be interpreted in several ways. A lot of di Prima's works were centered around feminism, class, and sexuality. It makes sense that this poem particularly talks about the artistic freedom and women's voice in the Beat movement of the '50s as compared to their male counterparts. Throughout this piece, di Prima talks about how poetry is her sustenance (“bread”), and it is a vital part of her life and living. She expresses how the voice of female poets is often muted when it contains strong themes and tones. That's why she fears her poems might be “unspent” and go “underground.” She is aware that her words are not “stone.” Thus, they will not be engraved upon and remain unchanged for centuries. However, she still believes that it will shine with all its might wherever her poetry lands.","you are my bread
and the hairline
noise
of my bones
you are almost
the sea

you are not stone
or molten sound
I think
you have no hands



this kind of bird flies backward
and this love
breaks on a windowpane
where no light talks

this is not time
for crossing tongues
(the sand here
never shifts)



I think
tomorrow
turned you with his toe
and you will
shine
and shine
unspent and underground",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54972/the-window-56d235f7b6c36
Spirits of the Dead by Edgar Allan Poe,Edgar Allan Poe,"'Spirits of the Dead' by Edgar Allan Poe describes death as the greatest of mysteries and something to be appreciated for its own beauties. The poem begins with the speaker describing how “you” are standing in a cemetery alone. The speaker describes how “you” are considering life and death and are entirely alone. They make a point to contrast how “you” might be alone in life but in death “you” are going to be surrounded by spirits of the dead. As the poem progresses, the speaker emphasizes the mysterious nature of death, warns against romanticizing it, and personifies nature.","I
Thy soul shall find itself alone
’Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone—
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
II
Be silent in that solitude,
Which is not loneliness—for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee—and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
III
The night, tho’ clear, shall frown—
And the stars shall look not down
From their high thrones in the heaven,
With light like Hope to mortals given—
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee for ever.
IV
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish,
Now are visions ne’er to vanish;
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more—like dew-drop from the grass.
V
The breeze—the breath of God—is still—
And the mist upon the hill,
Shadowy—shadowy—yet unbroken,
Is a symbol and a token—
How it hangs upon the trees,
A mystery of mysteries!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48632/spirits-of-the-dead
The Bell by Ralph Waldo Emerson,Ralph Waldo Emerson,"The Bell' by Ralph Waldo Emerson describes the various functions of a bell while also placing importance on its acknowledgment of death. In the first stanza of this piece the speaker begins by telling one specific bell that it is “mellow.” This “iron” sounding instrument functions in a variety of different ways. It notifies one of birth, death, and “heaven or hell.” Life and time are marked by its chiming. In the next two stanzas, the speaker moves through a number of different moments a bell can be used. The first of these is to notify a ship that land is near. This is a joyous occasion that is then contrasted with the quiet moments of attending church. Its history stretches back to a time that mysticism ruled. Emerson's speaker mentions “good men” attempting to “Disarm” thunder and lightning with the sound of a bell. The poem concludes with the speaker bringing the narrative back to his own life. There has been some tragedy in the area. It is far-stretching enough to call for a “death-bell.” The sound is going to be heard across the shore and mix with the wind and the speaker's own requiem.","I love thy music, mellow bell,
I love thine iron chime,
To life or death, to heaven or hell,
Which calls the sons of Time.

Thy voice upon the deep
The home-bound sea-boy hails,
It charms his cares to sleep,
It cheers him as he sails.

To house of God and heavenly joys
Thy summons called our sires,
And good men thought thy sacred voice
Disarmed the thunder's fires.

And soon thy music, sad death-bell,
Shall lift its notes once more,
And mix my requiem with the wind
That sweeps my native shore",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-bell/
The Deliverer by Tishani Doshi,Tishani Doshi,"'The Deliverer' by Tishani Doshi speaks on the prevalence of female infanticide in rural India and the lives of the women who help to commit it. The poem begins with the speaker stating that she and her mother are in a convent, looking for a child. This child, who was found buried and left for dead, is brought to America. Here she meets her adoptive parents, grows up, and then begins to look into her own story. The final lines describe the terrifying lives of women in rural India and the horrible choices they are forced to make.","The sister here is telling my mother
How she came to collect children
Because they were crippled or dark or girls.

Found naked in the streets,
Covered in garbage, stuffed in bags,
Abandoned at their doorstep.

One of them was dug up by a dog,
Thinking the head barely poking above the ground
Was bone or wood, something to chew.

This is the one my mother will bring.

MILWAUKEE AIRPORT, USA

The parents wait at the gates.
They are American so they know about ceremony
And tradition, about doing things right.

They haven't seen or touched her yet.
Don't know of her fetish for plucking hair off hands,
Or how her mother tried to bury her.

But they are crying.
We couldn't stop crying, my mother said,
Feeling the strangeness of her empty arms.


This girl grows up on video tapes,
Sees how she's passed from woman
To woman. She returns to twilight corners.

To the day of her birth, How it happens in some desolate hut
Outside village boundaries
Where mothers go to squeeze out life,

Watch body slither out from body,
Feel for penis or no penis,
Toss the baby to the heap of others,

Trudge home to lie down for their men again.","https://poemanalysis.com/tishani-doshi/the-deliverer/#:~:text='The%20Deliverer'%20by%20Tishani%20Doshi%20speaks%20on%20the%20prevalence%20of,convent%2C%20looking%20for%20a%20child."
The Lost Pilot by James Tate,James Tate,"'The Lost Pilot' by James Tate is about a grief-stricken son's imaginary conversation with his father, who died in World War II. This piece is dedicated to Tate's father, who was a co-pilot of a fighting jet. He died in combat in 1944 when Tate was barely a few months old. He did not see his father and grew up only with the memories implanted by others. Through this piece, he tries to show the love he has for his father. He delves through his deep emotions in order to unravel how he actually feels for him. His father did not think of his family nor of his infant child. He selfishly went to the battlefield and died. This poem is all about the loneliness, sadness, and angst of Tate.","Your face did not rot
like the others—the co-pilot, for example, I saw him
yesterday. His face is corn-
mush: his wife and daughter, the poor ignorant people, stare
as if he will compose soon.
He was more wronged than Job. But your face did not rot
like the others—it grew dark,
and hard like ebony;
the features progressed in their
distinction. If I could cajole
you to come back for an evening, down from your compulsive
orbiting, I would touch you, read your face as Dallas, your hoodlum gunner, now,
with the blistered eyes, reads his braille editions. I would
touch your face as a disinterested
scholar touches an original page. However frightening, I would discover you, and I would not
turn you in; I would not make you face your wife, or Dallas, or the co-pilot, Jim. You
could return to your crazy orbiting, and I would not try to fully understand what
it means to you. All I know is this: when I see you, as I have seen you at least
once every year of my life, spin across the wilds of the sky like a tiny, African god,
I feel dead. I feel as if I were the residue of a stranger’s life, that I should pursue you.
My head cocked toward the sky, I cannot get off the ground, and, you, passing over again,
fast, perfect, and unwilling to tell me that you are doing well, or that it was mistake
that placed you in that world,
and me in this; or that misfortune placed these worlds in us.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47810/the-lost-pilot
Calypso by Olga Broumas,Olga Broumas,"'Calypso' by Olga Broumas is about a speaker dreaming of having intimacy with a few imaginary women. In this poem, the speaker talks about how she gathers her imaginary friends like talismans and invites them for tarot card gossip. She imagines how they undress in her mind's studio. Their looks make her so unsettled that she can see a vagina folding itself like a mandala, a symbol of dream and self-fulfillment. The speaker uses their image in order to intensify her bodily desires. She lets the sensual tea steep till the bodily pot becomes black with the liquor. In this heightened state, she does not require anybody's assistance to please herself. Those imaginary characters are impregnated in her own mind. There is no need for any physical pain to seal her bond with them.","I’ve gathered the women like talismans, one
by one. They first came for tarot card
gossip, mystified
by my hands, by offers
cut with escape. They came

undone in my studio, sailing long eyes, heavy
with smoke and wet
with the force of dream: a vagina
folding mandala-like
out of herself, in full bloom. I used them. I used

the significance
of each card to uphold the dream, soon
they came back with others. I let the bitch
twitch in my lap. I listened. I let the tea steep
till the pot was black. Soon

there was no need for cards. We would use
stills from our daily lives, every woman
a constellation of images, every
portrait each other’s chart.
We came together

like months
in a lunar year, measured in nights, dividing
perfectly into female phases. Like women anywhere
living in groups we had synchronous menses. And had
no need of a wound, a puncture, to seal our bond.",https://circusfolk.tumblr.com/post/2159624116/calypso-by-olga-broumas/amp
Leda and the Swan by William Butler Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"The poem, 'Leda and the Swan' by William Butler Yeats, talks about the story of Greek mythology, the Copulation of Zeus (or Jupiter), and Leda. The poet narrates the story vividly, dramatically, and with almost a Dantesque concentration. A big bird, a swan with great wings has been represented as giving a sudden and staggering blow to the girl (Leda) bathing naked in a pond. The bird fluttering over her, caressing her thighs, holding her nape with his beak, and pressing her helpless (bare) breast upon his chest, must have been a nerve-shattering experience for the terrified girl. She was helpless in the clutches of the brute blood of their air, and her helplessness is signified by the 'loosening of her thighs', which is an expression rich in overtones of sexuality. In this way, an immortal god mated with a mortal girl. The event proved a fateful one as it set in motion a whole chain of events. The girl gave birth to Helen and the result was the Trojan War and the burning of the roof and 'topless' towers of Troy. She also gave birth to Clytemnestra and the result was the tragedy of Agamemnon. Clytemnestra was the queen of Agamemnon but she got so angry with him that she with the help of his children killed her own husband.","A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead.
Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43292/leda-and-the-swan
Home by Warsan Shire,Warsan Shire,"Home' by Warsan Shire describes the tragic journey of refugees in search of safety, shelter, and relief from the tremulous situation of their native country. In this poem, the speaker describes the situation that makes one leave their dear country, home, and belongings. When the big shark-like countrymen hunt down others, bloodthirsty and ferocious, there is no other way out than to flee one's country. The boy once the speaker made love with, holds a gun bigger than his body, waiting for her or his family. Thus, there is only one option left for the speaker: running. Throughout this poem, the narrator describes horrific events that refugees have to endure on their journey out. For instance, women are sexually exploited by men of their father's age. On top of that, they are sexually exploited by the prison guard. Reiterating the statement, “no one leaves home” or “no one chooses refugee camps” (or such a life), the narrator wants to portray the helplessness of the refugees worldwide. ","Mother says there are locked rooms inside all women; kitchen of lust,
bedroom of grief, bathroom of apathy.
Sometimes the men - they come with keys,
and sometimes, the men - they come with hammers.
 
 
Nin soo joog laga waayo, soo jiifso aa laga helaa,
I said Stop, I said No and he did not listen.
 
 
Perhaps she has a plan, perhaps she takes him back to hers
only for him to wake up hours later in a bathtub full of ice,
with a dry mouth, looking down at his new, neat procedure.
 
 
I point to my body and say Oh this old thing? No, I just slipped it on.

 
Are you going to eat that? I say to my mother, pointing to my father who is lying on the dining room table, his mouth stuffed with a red apple.
 
 
The bigger my body is, the more locked rooms there are, the more men come with keys. Anwar didn’t push it all the way in, I still think about what he could have opened up inside of me. Basil came and hesitated at the door for three years. Johnny with the blue eyes came with a bag of tools he had used on other women: one hairpin, a bottle of bleach, a switchblade and a jar of Vaseline. Yusuf called out God’s name through the keyhole and no one answered. Some begged, some climbed the side of my body looking for a window, some said they were on their way and did not come.
 
 
Show us on the doll where you were touched, they said.
I said I don’t look like a doll, I look like a house.
They said Show us on the house.

Like this: two fingers in the jam jar
Like this: an elbow in the bathwater
Like this: a hand in the drawer.

 
I should tell you about my first love who found a trapdoor under my left breast nine years ago, fell in and hasn’t been seen since. Every
now and then I feel something crawling up my thigh. He should make himself known, I’d probably let him out. I hope he hasn’t
bumped in to the others, the missing boys from small towns, with pleasant mothers, who did bad things and got lost in the maze of
my hair. I treat them well enough, a slice of bread, if they’re lucky a piece of fruit. Except for Johnny with the blue eyes, who picked my locks and crawled in. Silly boy, chained to the basement of my fears, I play music to drown him out.
 
Knock knock.
Who’s there?
No one.

At parties I point to my body and say This is where love comes to die. Welcome, come in, make yourself at home. Everyone laughs, they think I’m joking.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/90733/the-house-57daba5625f32
If— by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling,"'If—' is an inspirational poem that provides advice on how one should live one's life. The poem takes the reader through various ways in which the reader can rise above adversity that will almost certainly be thrown one's way at some point. Throughout the poem, the speaker gives the reader multiple scenarios, both positive and negative, along with a glimpse into how one should conduct oneself. The poem has an almost mathematical proof about it with its if-then scenario. Kipling leaves the “then” until the final two lines, revealing to the reader that if he or she is able to do all that was just mentioned, he or she will not only have the world at his or her fingertips, but he or she will also be a “Man.”","If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!",poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---
Classic Ballroom Dances by Charles Simic,Charles Simic,'Classic Ballroom Dances' by Charles Simic describes the daily acts of a few human beings and compares those to the idea of dancing/art. This piece presents a set of images in each stanza. The first stanza begins with two sets of images. Simic depicts how the grandmothers wring the necks of chickens and old nuns pull the naughty schoolboys by the ear. Even a pickpocket's intricate movement captures his attention. He connects these daily acts to the art of dancing in the final stanza of the poem.,"Grandmothers who wring the necks
Of chickens; old nuns
With names like Theresa, Marianne,
Who pull schoolboys by the ear;

The intricate steps of pickpockets
Working the crowd of the curious
At the scene of an accident; the slow shuffle
Of the evangelist with a sandwich-board;

The hesitation of the early morning customer
Peeking through the window-grille
Of a pawnshop; the weave of a little kid
Who is walking to school with eyes closed;

And the ancient lovers, cheek to cheek,
On the dancefloor of the Union Hall,
Where they also hold charity raffles
On rainy Monday nights of an eternal November.",https://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php%3Fdate=2004%252F04%252F14.html
The Broken Chain by Ron Tranmer,Ron Tranmer,"'The Broken Chain' by Ron Tranmer is a widely relatable poem that explores familial loss. The poem begins with the speaker directing their words to a specific listener, someone who has passed away. The speaker and their family members did not know that this person was going to die that day or “that God was going to call your name.” But, the speaker explains how everyone on Earth loves this deceased person in the same way they did when they were alive. As the poem progresses, the speaker describes how everyone is devastated that this person has died, but they did not go to Heaven alone. Memories and love went with them, and one day they will all be reunited in Heaven at God's side.","We little knew the day that
God was going to call your name.
In life we loved you dearly,
In death we do the same.
 
It broke our hearts to lose you
But  you didn’t go alone.
For part of us went with you
The day God called you home.
 
You left us peaceful memories.
Your love is still our guide,
And though we cannot see you
You are always at our side.
 
Our family chain is broken
and nothing seems the same,
but as God calls us one by one
the chain will link again.",https://www.rontranmer.com/broken-chain-original/
Fork by Charles Simic,Charles Simic,"'Fork' by Charles Simic is an imaginative poem about how a speaker views and handles forks. The poem starts with a surprising comparison between a fork and a strange thing that's crawled “right out of hell.” It's creature-like, specifically like the foot of a bird. The fork-creature also looks like something that might be worn as a trophy around a cannibal's neck. As the poem continues, the speaker crafts an even stronger image of “you” using the work and one's fist becoming the beakless, blind head of a bird.","This strange thing must have crept
Right out of hell.
It resembles a bird’s foot
Worn around the cannibal’s neck.
As you hold it in your hand,
As you stab with it into a piece of meat,
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:
Its head which like your fist
Is large, bald, beakless, and blind.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42950/fork
Part VI: The Rime of The Ancient Mariner by S.T. Coleridge,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"The sixth part of 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge depicts the Mariner's return to his homeland. The first and second voice introduced in the fifth section continue to talk in the sixth. They explain that the sea and the moon are working to navigate the ship and then fly away. The Mariner wakes up beside the dead sailors and the ship moves steadily onward, eventually arriving at the Mariner's home. There, he weeps and prays that he isn't dreaming. He sees the angels leave the bodies of the dead soldiers and hears silent music. Finally, he sees a small boat with several people in it. He hopes the Hermit will be able to absolve him of his sin of killing the albatross.","First Voice
'But tell me, tell me! speak again,
Thy soft response renewing—
What makes that ship drive on so fast?
What is the ocean doing?'

Second Voice
Still as a slave before his lord,
The ocean hath no blast;
His great bright eye most silently
Up to the Moon is cast—

If he may know which way to go;
For she guides him smooth or grim.
See, brother, see! how graciously
She looketh down on him.'

First Voice
'But why drives on that ship so fast,
Without or wave or wind?'

Second Voice
'The air is cut away before,
And closes from behind.

Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!
Or we shall be belated:
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated.'

I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
The dead men stood together.

All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.

The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.

And now this spell was snapt: once more
I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw
Of what had else been seen—

Like one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.

But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.

It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring—
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.

Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze—
On me alone it blew.

Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
The light-house top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
Is this mine own countree?

We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray—
O let me be awake, my God!
Or let me sleep alway.

The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the Moon.

The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,
That stands above the rock:
The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock.

And the bay was white with silent light,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came.

A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:
I turned my eyes upon the deck—
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!

Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,
And, by the holy rood!
A man all light, a seraph-man,
On every corse there stood.

This seraph-band, each waved his hand:
It was a heavenly sight!
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light;

This seraph-band, each waved his hand,
No voice did they impart—
No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on my heart.

But soon I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the Pilot's cheer;
My head was turned perforce away
And I saw a boat appear.

The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
The dead men could not blast.

I saw a third—I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834
Mariana by Alfred Lord Tennyson,Alfred Lord Tennyson,"Mariana' by Alfred Lord Tennyson is a dark and depressing poem that depicts the emotional strife of a young woman who is abandoned by her lover. The stanzas of this poem take the reader through a series of images that depict outwardly the inner emotional turmoil that Mariana is experiencing. Her emotions are transmuted onto the larger setting. The speaker describes a dark and abandoned farmhouse that is falling apart. It is in desperate need of repair but no one is there to tend to it. Just as Mariana's mind is slipping away from light, happiness, and hope for the future, so too are her surroundings. Towards the middle of the poem, a very important image shows itself, a poplar tree. It is the only thing to be seen on the flat and featureless landscape that surrounds the farmhouse. This tree, which stands upright in an otherwise flat field, is often interpreted as a phallic symbol. This is emphasized by the poplar tree's shadow that falls across Mariana's bed at night. The speaker does not reach a conclusion about Mariana's future nor does Mariana make any kind of transition away from mourning her lover. Rather, the poem continues to reiterate these dark symbols and emotions. It concludes with Mariana stating that she has become “dreary“.","With blackest moss the flower-plots
Were thickly crusted, one and all:
The rusted nails fell from the knots
That held the pear to the gable-wall.
The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:
Unlifted was the clinking latch;
Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
Upon the lonely moated grange.
She only said, ""My life is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

Her tears fell with the dews at even;
Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;
She could not look on the sweet heaven,
Either at morn or eventide.
After the flitting of the bats,
When thickest dark did trance the sky,
She drew her casement-curtain by,
And glanced athwart the glooming flats.
She only said, ""The night is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

Upon the middle of the night,
Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:
The cock sung out an hour ere light:
From the dark fen the oxen's low
Came to her: without hope of change,
In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,
Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn
About the lonely moated grange.
She only said, ""The day is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

About a stone-cast from the wall
A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,
And o'er it many, round and small,
The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.
Hard by a poplar shook alway,
All silver-green with gnarled bark:
For leagues no other tree did mark
The level waste, the rounding gray.
She only said, ""My life is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said ""I am aweary, aweary
I would that I were dead!""

And ever when the moon was low,
And the shrill winds were up and away,
In the white curtain, to and fro,
She saw the gusty shadow sway.
But when the moon was very low
And wild winds bound within their cell,
The shadow of the poplar fell
Upon her bed, across her brow.
She only said, ""The night is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

All day within the dreamy house,
The doors upon their hinges creak'd;
The blue fly sung in the pane; the mouse
Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,
Or from the crevice peer'd about.
Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors
Old footsteps trod the upper floors,
Old voices called her from without.
She only said, ""My life is dreary,
He cometh not,"" she said;
She said, ""I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead!""

The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,
The slow clock ticking, and the sound
Which to the wooing wind aloof
The poplar made, did all confound
Her sense; but most she loathed the hour
When the thick-moted sunbeam lay
Athwart the chambers, and the day
Was sloping toward his western bower.
Then said she, ""I am very dreary,
He will not come,"" she said;
She wept, ""I am aweary, aweary,
Oh God, that I were dead!""",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45365/mariana
The Girl with the Keys to Pearse’s Cottage by Paul Durcan,Paul Durcan,"'The Girl with the Keys to Pearse's Cottage' by Paul Durcan reflects on a speaker's memories of the cottage and the girl who had the keys, Cáit Killann. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by describing Cáit and telling the reader he met her when he was sixteen. She used to sit in the window of Pearse's cottage, while he sat below in the field writing love poems to her. Their “world” was a “strange” one as it had no future. She departed for America and he was left with his poignant memories of her.","When I was sixteen I met a dark girl;
Her dark hair was darker because her smile was so bright;
She was the girl with the keys to Pearse's Cottage;
And her name was Cáit Killann.

The cottage was built into the side of a hill;
I recall two windows and a cosmic peace
Of bare brown rooms and on whitewashed walls
Photographs of the passionate and pale Pearse.

I recall wet thatch and peeling jambs
And how all was best seen from below in the field;
I used to sit in the rushes with ledger-book and pencil
Compiling poems of passion for Cáit Killann.


Often she used linger on the sill of a window;
Hands by her side and brown legs akimbo;
In sun-red skirt and moon-black blazer;
Looking toward our strange world wide-eyed.

Our world was strange because it had no future;
She was America-bound at summer's end.
She had no choice but to leave her home -
The girl with the keys to Pearse's Cottage.

O Cáit Killann, O Cáit Killann,
You have gone with your keys from your own native place.
Yet here in this dark - El Greco eyes blaze back
From your Connemara postman's daughter's proudly mortal face.",https://genius.com/Paul-durcan-the-girl-with-the-keys-to-pearses-cottage-annotated
Dog by Lawrence Ferlinghetti,Lawrence Ferlinghetti ,"'Dog' by Lawrence Ferlinghetti is a philosophically complex poem that uses the perspective of a dog to speak on free will and religion. This poem takes the reader through a series of images that are described through a dog's eyes. He sees lamp posts as trees with moons and ascribes importance and unimportance to different things that a human might. He's willing to eat the cow or the policeman but would prefer the former. The dog follows his nose, understands the things that are larger than himself and smaller. He knows reality and sees it as his existence allows him to. In the middle of the poem, Ferlinghetti introduces politics and a discussion about free will through reference to a specific congressman that the dog is disturbed by. He isn't afraid of this person, as he knows the truth about his own nature, but he is bothered. Towards the end of the poem the language becomes more complex, the margins disappear and Ferlinghetti introduces themes of free will, God, religion, politics, and the meaning of life.","The dog trots freely in the street
and sees reality
and the things he sees
are bigger than himself
and the things he sees
are his reality
Drunks in doorways
Moons on trees
The dog trots freely thru the street
and the things he sees
are smaller than himself
Fish on newsprint
Ants in holes
Chickens in Chinatown windows
their heads a block away
The dog trots freely in the street
and the things he smells
smell something like himself
The dog trots freely in the street
past puddles and babies
cats and cigars
poolrooms and policemen
He doesn’t hate cops
He merely has no use for them
and he goes past them
and past the dead cows hung up whole
in front of the San Francisco Meat Market
He would rather eat a tender cow
than a tough policeman
though either might do
And he goes past the Romeo Ravioli Factory
and past Coit’s Tower
and past Congressman Doyle
He’s afraid of Coit’s Tower
but he’s not afraid of Congressman Doyle
although what he hears is very discouraging
very depressing
very absurd
to a sad young dog like himself
to a serious dog like himself
But he has his own free world to live in
His own fleas to eat
He will not be muzzled
Congressman Doyle is just another
fire hydrant
to him

and has his own dog’s life to live
and to think about
and to reflect upon

investigating everything

and how to hear it

at streetcorners

his picture taken
for Victor Records
listening for
His Master’s Voice

For the Fallen by Laurence Binyon,Laurence Binyon,"'For the Fallen' by Laurence Binyon addresses the loss of lives in World War I and how they will live on forever in the stars. In the first lines of 'For the Fallen,' the speaker begins by personifying England. He depicts the country as a mother to all her citizens. She thanks them for the services they've given to her. She “mourns her dead across the sea.” They are lost to her shores, but she recognizes the sacrifice they've made. It soon becomes clear that they were fighting for freedom, specifically in the First World War. Despite how terrible these losses are, there is still music. It celebrates their bravery. The following stanzas depict what the soldiers were like who marched into battle. They were sharp, young, loyal, filled with patriotic duty, and firm in their stance against the enemy. They knew their chances of surviving the war were slim, but they fought on and faced down death until it took them. The speaker discusses how things have changed drastically for these men. They are never going to return home to their families and sit around the table again. They've been put to rest far from their native land. But, they will live on in their family member's memories and in the hearts of all those who benefit from their service. They will shine in the sky as eternal stars, outlasting those who did not die in the war.","With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,
England mourns for her dead across the sea.
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,
Fallen in the cause of the free.

Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal 
Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres,
There is music in the midst of desolation
And a glory that shines upon our tears.

They went with songs to the battle, they were young,
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;
They fell with their faces to the foe.

They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: 
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.

They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; 
They sit no more at familiar tables of home;
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;
They sleep beyond England's foam.

But where our desires are and our hopes profound, 
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known
As the stars are known to the Night;

As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, 
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;
As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, 
To the end, to the end, they remain.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57322/for-the-fallen
The Naked and the Nude by Robert Graves,Robert Graves,"The Naked and the Nude' by Robert Graves is a clever and complicated poem that depicts the difference, or lack thereof, between nakedness and nudity. The speaker addresses the two ways of being as wholly different from one another. They are as estranged as lies and love and art and truth. The poet uses several examples to describe how these two things are different, as seen through the eyes of doctors, lovers, and art. But, by the end of the poem, he comes to the conclusion that in reality they really aren't so different. Whether one is naked or nude the afterlife is always waiting.","For me, the naked and the nude
(By lexicographers construed
As synonyms that should express
The same deficiency of dress
Or shelter) stand as wide apart
As love from lies, or truth from art.

Lovers without reproach will gaze
On bodies naked and ablaze;
The Hippocratic eye will see
In nakedness, anatomy;
And naked shines the Goddess when
She mounts her lion among men.

The nude are bold, the nude are sly
To hold each treasonable eye.
While draping by a showman's trick
Their dishabille in rhetoric,
They grin a mock-religious grin
Of scorn at those of naked skin.

The naked, therefore, who compete
Against the nude may know defeat;
Yet when they both together tread
The briary pastures of the dead,
By Gorgons with long whips pursued,
How naked go the sometimes nude!",https://allpoetry.com/The-Naked-And-The-Nude
Snowfall in the Afternoon by Robert Bly,Robert Bly,"'Snowfall in the Afternoon' by Robert Bly is a beautiful poem describing how snow transforms a landscape. Throughout interesting images that focus on the transformation of a landscape, the poet creates a semi-surrealistic, dreamlike narrative. It ends with the image of blind sailors on a boat at sea for many years. The poem leaves readers without any answers to their questions and will likely create a variety of impressions.","1

The grass is half-covered with snow.
It was the sort of snowfall that starts in late afternoon
And now the little houses of the grass are growing dark.

2

If I reached my hands down near the earth
I could take handfuls of darkness!
A darkness was always there which we never noticed.

3

As the snow grows heavier the cornstalks fade farther away
And the barn moves nearer to the house.
The barn moves all alone in the growing storm.

4

The barn is full of corn and moves toward us now
Like a hulk blown toward us in a storm at sea;
All the sailors on deck have been blind for many years.",https://www.poemine.com/Robert-Bly/Snowfall-in-the-Afternoon.html
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"The poem opens with the speaker putting forward a simple question: can he compare his lover to a summer’s day? Historically, the theme of summertime has always been used to evoke a certain amount of beauty, particularly in poetry. Summer has always been seen as the respite from the long, bitter winter, a growing period where the earth flourishes itself with flowers and with animals once more. Thus, to compare his lover to a summer’s day, the speaker considers their beloved to be tantamount to a rebirth, and even better than summer itself. As summer is occasionally short, too hot, and rough, summer is, in fact, not the height of beauty for this particular speaker. Instead, he attributes that quality to his beloved, whose beauty will never fade, even when ‘death brag thou waander’stin his shade‘, as he will immortalize his lover’s beauty in his verse.","Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimmed,

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,

Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,

 So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,

 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",https://poemanalysis.com/william-shakespeare/best-love-sonnets/
Preludes by T.S. Eliot,T.S. Eliot,"Preludes' by T.S. Eliot contains a complex imagistic narrative on the dark and depressing nature of city life and the state of the human soul. The poem begins with the speaker describing a city just entering into the night. He pays close attention to the smell of steak in the air and the fact that there is a lot of grime on the ground. There are newspapers and many other miscellaneous pieces of trash. All of these blow around “your” feet. The first section ends with all the indoor lamps turning on. When the poem resumes in the second section it is morning again and the city is regaining consciousness. There is a smell of beer on the air and everyone is pulling up their dirty blinds, unhappy to face another day that is exactly like the last. The third section depicts “your” particular experience. This person had a night filled with sordid dreams straight from the soul. When “you” finally get up, it takes some time but “you” eventually make it back into “your” life. The last lines give the reader a little bit of hope that maybe the timeless, miserable way of living will not go on forever. ","The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six o’clock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.


The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.

With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.


You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed’s edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.


His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six o’clock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44214/preludes-56d22338dc954
Bluebeard by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"Bluebeard' by Edna St. Vincent Millay takes the myth of Bluebeard and his secret room and retells it, using the room as a powerful symbol. In the first lines, the speaker, who a reader may assume is Bluebeard himself, addresses his wife. He speaks calmly but with a clear disappointment and solemnity. His wife went into the one place in the entire castle that he asked her not to. Now, in his irritation and disappointment, he shows her around the empty room, thus proving to her that there's nothing to fear. Unlike the original story, the room is empty. It doesn't contain the heads of his previous wives. She betrayed him for nothing. He calls her action greedy. She took the one thing from him he wanted to keep for himself. The poem concludes with Bluebeard telling the wife that she can have the whole “place”. He's going to find somewhere else that he can live without the threat of betrayal and the invasion of his personal physical and mental space. ","This door you might not open, and you did;
So enter now, and see for what slight thing
You are betrayed... Here is no treasure hid,
No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring
The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain
For greed like yours, no writhings of distress,
But only what you see... Look yet again—
An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless.
Yet this alone out of my life I kept
Unto myself, lest any know me quite;
And you did so profane me when you crept
Unto the threshold of this room to-night
That I must never more behold your face.
This now is yours. I seek another place.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/bluebeard/
To a Friend by Amy Lowell,Amy Lowell,"To a Friend' by Amy Lowell presents the importance of friendship in a person's life. 'To a Friend' by Amy Lowell, the poetic persona asks her friend only one thing, “always you will be my dream of you”. The line says it all. The poet adores the bond friendship much more than anything else in her life. She believes it is hard to find a friend and to keep the friendship is harder enough. In this world, it is not easy to find a person who can understand one's true self. If the poet finds one, she never wants to befriend that person. She knows, “The world is full of rude awakenings” but she also believes in “beauty through all wrongs”. It is the beauty of friendship which makes her life lyrical as a song.","I ask but one thing of you, only one,
That always you will be my dream of you;
That never shall I wake to find untrue
All this I have believed and rested on,
Forever vanished, like a vision gone
Out into the night. Alas, how few
There are who strike in us a chord we knew
Existed, but so seldom heard its tone
We tremble at the half-forgotten sound.
The world is full of rude awakenings
And heaven-born castles shattered to the ground,
Yet still our human longing vainly clings
To a belief in beauty through all wrongs.
O stay your hand, and leave my heart its songs!",https://www.potw.org/archive/potw217.html
Drifting Flowers of the Sea by Sadakichi Hartmann,Sadakichi Hartmann,"'Drifting Flowers of the Sea' by Sadakichi Hartmann describes the presence of white flowers in the sea, and their relation to perseverance and unspoken dreams. The poem begins with the speaker setting the scene. He is on a beach and his feet are just touching the water. Night has fallen around him and the only light that remains is that which comes from the moon. He seems to be at a point of convergence where the wind, sea, and moon are all present. The main characters of the poem surface from the depths of the sea, they are white, pure, flowers. These flowers are representations of the speaker's unspoken words and unrealized dreams. The flowers exist no matter what humankind does to the planet, and will be there long after all human beings are gone.","Across the dunes, in the waning light,
The rising moon pours her amber rays,
Through the slumbrous air of the dim, brown night
The pungent smell of the seaweed strays—
From vast and trackless spaces
Where wind and water meet,
White flowers, that rise from the sleepless deep,
Come drifting to my feet.
They flutter the shore in a drowsy tune,
Unfurl their bloom to the lightlorn sky,
Allow a caress to the rising moon,
Then fall to slumber, and fade, and die.
White flowers, a-bloom on the vagrant deep,
Like dreams of love, rising out of sleep,
You are the songs, I dreamt but never sung,
Pale hopes my thoughts alone have known,
Vain words ne’er uttered, though on the tongue,
That winds to the sibilant seas have blown.
In you, I see the everlasting drift of years
That will endure all sorrows, smiles and tears;
For when the bell of time will ring the doom
To all the follies of the human race,
You still will rise in fugitive bloom
And garland the shores of ruined space.",https://poets.org/poem/drifting-flowers-sea
The Émigrée by Carol Rumens,Carol Rumens,"The Émigrée' by Carol Rumens best pictures childhood idealization, and teaches a lot to readers about the miserable situation of the refugees. 'The Émigrée' by Carol Rumens is a poem about a child who emigrated to a new city. The child's feelings and realization after coming into a new culture and linguistic environment, form the basis of the poem. Moreover, the “sunlight” clear memory of her native place, presents how much she adored her old city. Apart from that, there is a constant conflict in her heart regarding the new city. She can't speak the language properly. However, the past seems to hold her back and resist her from getting into the new journey. At last, she strongly claims her cultural identity as if the shadow behind her in the daylight, is nothing but her old identity. Along with that, the sunlight reminds her of the value of her culture that is going to be washed away in near future.","There once was a country... I left it as a child
but my memory of it is sunlight-clear
for it seems I never saw it in that November
which, I am told, comes to the mildest city.
The worst news I receive of it cannot break
my original view, the bright, filled paperweight.
It may be at war, it may be sick with tyrants,
but I am branded by an impression of sunlight.

The white streets of that city, the graceful slopes
glow even clearer as time rolls its tanks
and the frontiers rise between us, close like waves.
That child’s vocabulary I carried here
like a hollow doll, opens and spills a grammar.
Soon I shall have every coloured molecule of it.
It may by now be a lie, banned by the state
but I can’t get it off my tongue. It tastes of sunlight.

I have no passport, there’s no way back at all
but my city comes to me in its own white plane.
It lies down in front of me, docile as paper;
I comb its hair and love its shining eyes.
My city takes me dancing through the city
of walls. They accuse me of absence, they circle me.
They accuse me of being dark in their free city.
My city hides behind me. They mutter death,
and my shadow falls as evidence of sunlight.",https://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/the-emigr-e
Sunday Morning by Wallace Stevens,Wallace Stevens,"'Sunday Morning' by Wallace Stevens discusses the nature of the afterlife and the role of God and nature in the creation of paradise. The poem begins with the speaker describing a woman spending her Sunday morning sitting outside rather than going to church. She falls into a dream that makes her feel guilty about the death of Christ. The dream includes a journey to Palestine and Christ's tomb. Although she feels something, she is still skeptical about religion. She isn't ready to give up her life and all its pleasures to the Christian god. In the next stanza, the speaker compares Christ to the Greek and Roman god Jove. Jove is different because he only represents the sun, rather than actually being it. The speaker wonders over the desire of humans to create religion and whether or not paradise can exist. The next section returns to the perspective of the woman who is described as finding peace in the sight of birds waking, walking around, and taking off for a day of the flight. She believes that beauty is something to be loved and Death to be feared. The speaker pushes back against this opinion stating that beauty cannot exist without Death. In an effort to illustrate his point he describes the actions of pagan men who worship the sun because of its influence on the land rather than what powers it might wield as a god. The men are not burdened by the expectations of the Christian god, or any all-seeing, commanding power. They simply exist in the world, similar to how nature will exist in the final stanza. The last stanza contains another portion of the woman's dream of Christ's tomb. This time the vision is speaking to her and describing the tomb as nothing more than a burial place. It is not home to spirits. In conclusion, the speaker goes over everything he previously stated and ends with a wish to know nature without looking through a human lens.","Complacencies of the peignoir, and late
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,
And the green freedom of a cockatoo
Upon a rug mingle to dissipate
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark
Encroachment of that old catastrophe,
As a calm darkens among water-lights.
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings
Seem things in some procession of the dead,
Winding across wide water, without sound.
The day is like wide water, without sound,
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet
Over the seas, to silent Palestine,
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.


Why should she give her bounty to the dead?
What is divinity if it can come
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else
In any balm or beauty of the earth,
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?
Divinity must live within herself:
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;
All pleasures and all pains, remembering
The bough of summer and the winter branch.
These are the measures destined for her soul.


Jove in the clouds had his inhuman birth.
No mother suckled him, no sweet land gave
Large-mannered motions to his mythy mind.
He moved among us, as a muttering king,
Magnificent, would move among his hinds,
Until our blood, commingling, virginal,
With heaven, brought such requital to desire
The very hinds discerned it, in a star.
Shall our blood fail? Or shall it come to be
The blood of paradise? And shall the earth
Seem all of paradise that we shall know?
The sky will be much friendlier then than now,
A part of labor and a part of pain,
And next in glory to enduring love,
Not this dividing and indifferent blue.


She says, “I am content when wakened birds,
Before they fly, test the reality
Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;
But when the birds are gone, and their warm fields
Return no more, where, then, is paradise?”
There is not any haunt of prophecy,
Nor any old chimera of the grave,
Neither the golden underground, nor isle
Melodious, where spirits gat them home,
Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palm
Remote on heaven’s hill, that has endured
As April’s green endures; or will endure
Like her remembrance of awakened birds,
Or her desire for June and evening, tipped
By the consummation of the swallow’s wings.


She says, “But in contentment I still feel
The need of some imperishable bliss.”
Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,
Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams
And our desires. Although she strews the leaves
Of sure obliteration on our paths,
The path sick sorrow took, the many paths
Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love
Whispered a little out of tenderness,
She makes the willow shiver in the sun
For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze
Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet.
She causes boys to pile new plums and pears
On disregarded plate. The maidens taste
And stray impassioned in the littering leaves.


Is there no change of death in paradise?
Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs
Hang always heavy in that perfect sky,
Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,
With rivers like our own that seek for seas
They never find, the same receding shores
That never touch with inarticulate pang?
Why set the pear upon those river-banks
Or spice the shores with odors of the plum?
Alas, that they should wear our colors there,
The silken weavings of our afternoons,
And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!
Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,
Within whose burning bosom we devise
Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.


Supple and turbulent, a ring of men
Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn
Their boisterous devotion to the sun,
Not as a god, but as a god might be,
Naked among them, like a savage source.
Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,
Out of their blood, returning to the sky;
And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,
The windy lake wherein their lord delights,
The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,
That choir among themselves long afterward.
They shall know well the heavenly fellowship
Of men that perish and of summer morn.
And whence they came and whither they shall go
The dew upon their feet shall manifest.


She hears, upon that water without sound,
A voice that cries, “The tomb in Palestine
Is not the porch of spirits lingering.
It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.”
We live in an old chaos of the sun,
Or old dependency of day and night,
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,
Of that wide water, inescapable.
Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail
Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;
Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;
And, in the isolation of the sky,
At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make
Ambiguous undulations as they sink,
Downward to darkness, on extended wings.",poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13261/sunday-morning
He Would Never Use One Word Where None Would Do by Philip Levine,Philip Levine,Form and Tone 'He Would Never Use One Word Where None Would Do' is written in free verse and treads the fine line between prose and poetry. It is forty four lines long and only contains eight sentences over its duration. This gives the poem a feel of being stream of consciousness. This is an interesting device to use in a poem that is about a guy who is quite economical with his words.,"If you said ""Nice day,"" he would look up
at the three clouds riding overhead,
nod at each, and go back to doing what-
ever he was doing or not doing.
If you asked for a smoke or a light,
he'd hand you whatever he found
in his pockets: a jackknife, a hankie --
usually unsoiled -- a dollar bill,
a subway token. Once he gave me
half the sandwich he was eating
at the little outdoor restaurant
on La Guardia Place. I remember
a single sparrow was perched on the back
of his chair, and when he held out
a piece of bread on his open palm,
the bird snatched it up and went back to
its place without even a thank you,
one hard eye staring at my bad eye
as though I were next. That was in May
of '97, spring had come late,
but the sun warmed both of us for hours
while silence prevailed, if you can call
the blaring of taxi horns and the trucks
fighting for parking and the kids on skates
streaming past silence. My friend Frankie
was such a comfort to me that year,
the year of the crisis. He would turn
up his great dark head just going gray
until his eyes met mine, and that was all
I needed to go on talking nonsense
as he sat patiently waiting me out,
the bird staring over his shoulder.
""Silence is silver,"" my Zaydee had said,
getting it wrong and right, just as he said
""Water is thicker than blood,"" thinking
this made him a real American.
Frankie was already American,
being half German, half Indian.
Fact is, silence is the perfect water:
unlike rain it falls from no clouds
to wash our minds, to ease our tired eyes,
to give heart to the thin blades of grass
fighting through the concrete for even air
dirtied by our endless stream of words.",https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/poetry/antholog/levine/oneword.htm
A Bard’s Epitaph by Robert Burns,Robert Burns,"'A Bard's Epitaph' by Robert Burns describes how the poet was as a human being and what one could learn from his life. 'A Bard's Epitaph' by Robert Burns talks about the poet's imaginary grave in the first stanza. It draws the attention of the people who throng around it at times. Moreover, the lines written in the poet's grave remind of his contribution to Scottish literary tradition. There is a wise person who stands by the grave of the poet. Even the person drops a tear to see the “whim-inspired fool” who once pleased people with his rusting songs. Whereas in the last two stanzas, the poet talks about his mindless follies that stained his “name”. At last, the poet requests the readers to learn from his life. One should know that prudence, alertness, and self-control are the three ingredients that make one wise in life.","Is there a whim-inspired fool,
Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule,
Owre blate to seek, owre proud to snool,
Let him draw near;
And owre this grassy heap sing dool,
And drap a tear.

Is there a bard of rustic song,
Who, noteless, steals the crowds among,
That weekly this area throng,
O, pass not by!
But, with a frater-feeling strong,
Here, heave a sigh.

Is there a man, whose judgment clear
Can others teach the course to steer,
Yet runs, himself, life's mad career,
Wild as the wave,
Here pause-and, thro' the starting tear,
Survey this grave.

The poor inhabitant below
Was quick to learn the wise to know,
And keenly felt the friendly glow,
And softer flame;
But thoughtless follies laid him low,
And stain'd his name!

Reader, attend! whether thy soul
Soars fancy's flights beyond the pole,
Or darkling grubs this earthly hole,
In low pursuit:
Know, prudent, cautious, self-control
Is wisdom's root.",https://allpoetry.com/A-Bard's-Epitaph
The Need to Recall the Journey by Sujata Bhatt,Sujata Bhatt,"'The Need to Recall the Journey' by Sujata Bhatt depicts a mother's desire to return, time and time again, to memories of childbirth. The poem starts with the speaker describing how it's very easy to take herself back to the moments her child was only partially born. She nurses her baby and remembers what it was like to be in labor and feel her child being born but not having her in the world yet. As her child was born, it was like letting go of a loved one about to embark on a long ship voyage, she writes. It's sorrowful but something that one has to accept. Now, time has passed, and her body has healed. But, this only seems to inspire the speaker to retell stories of her child's birth with more urgency, trying to recapture what the experience was like.","Now when she cries
 for milk,
now as she drinks
 I drift back
to the moments when she was
almost out
still part of me
but already I could reach down
 and touch her hair.
I want to return
to her moment of birth.
It was too quick.
I want it to go on –
When the pain was suddenly
defined by her head,
when she was about to slide out
 safely
all by herself – I felt my heart
go half-way out with her …
like seeing a beloved one off
to a harbour, to a ship
destined to go
to a far away place
 you’ve never been to …
But I could touch
 her hair –
a thick, fuzzy heat.
Sticky feathers clung
wet to runny whites of eggs …
But this is a little person
who already has
a favourite sleeping position.

Weeks pass, the bleeding stops.
Months pass –
What I thought could never heal
actually heals.
And still there is this need
to recall the journey,
retell the story.
The urge
to reopen every detail
until our faces glow again.
What are we
trying to understand?",cienotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9695_w11_qp_32.pdf
Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"'Ode to the West Wind' by Percy Bysshe Shelley focuses on the west wind, a powerful and destructive force, yet a necessary one. In the first lines, the speaker addresses the wind and describes how it creates deadly storms. it drives away the summer and brings with it the cold and darkness of winter. He imagines what it would be like to be a dead leaf lifted and blown around by the wind and he implores the wind to lift him “as a wave, a lead, a cloud!” The speaker sees the wind as a necessary evil, one that eventually means that spring is on the way.","I
O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,

Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed

The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:

Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!

II
Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky's commotion,
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,

Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine aëry surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head

Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith's height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge

Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre,
Vaulted with all thy congregated might

Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh hear!

III
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lull'd by the coil of his crystalline streams,

Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,

All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic's level powers

Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know

Thy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: oh hear!

IV
If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share

The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be

The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seem'd a vision; I would ne'er have striven

As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.

V
Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,

Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth

The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45134/ode-to-the-west-wind
"You Are Old, Father William by Lewis Carroll",Lewis Carroll,"‘You Are Old, Father William’ by Lewis Carroll is a poem that is structured as a dialogue between a “father” and “his son,” though the details given for the pair vary and cause confusion in regard to who is involved in this exchange. This confusion pairs well with the odd inquiries posed by the “son,” as well as the odd responses of the “father,” and the mixture of bizarre proves to be a perfect circumstance to mirror the theme of ‘You Are Old, Father William’. That theme involves generation gaps—specifically how different generations can fail to understand one another.","""You are old, father William,"" the young man said,
""And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head —
Do you think, at your age, it is right?""
""In my youth,"" father William replied to his son,
""I feared it would injure the brain;
But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again.""
""You are old,"" said the youth, ""as I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door —
Pray, what is the reason of that?""
""In my youth,"" said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
""I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment — one shilling the box —
Allow me to sell you a couple.""
""You are old,"" said the youth, ""and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak —
Pray, how did you manage to do it?""
""In my youth,"" said his father, ""I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life.""
""You are old,"" said the youth; one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose —
What made you so awfully clever?""
""I have answered three questions, and that is enough,""
Said his father; ""don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!""
""That is not said right,"" said the Caterpillar. ""Not quite right, I'm afraid,"" said Alice timidly;
""some of the words have got altered.""
""It is wrong from beginning to end,""
said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.",https://allpoetry.com/Father-William
Inauguration by Lorenzo Thomas,Lorenzo Thomas,"Inauguration by Lorenzo Thomas begins by focusing on the 'land', then moving on to human issues. We have occupied the land, it has been here long before we were. Even knowing this invasion, humanity has proceeded to destroy the world, leaking waves of pollution into the atmosphere all while social inequality is rampant. Thomas moves through these ideas, looking at war and bombings as his first point of contention. Thomas follows this by looking at the factors that underline societal values, 'acumen', and a 'carnivorous' nature that places money and the economy as more important than human life. Further destroying the land, humanity has allowed 'deadly smoke' to pool over 'icecaps', global warming caused by relentless progress without caution. Especially considering the close links with the word 'inauguration' and the American political system, combined with the focus on 'bull markets' (the New York Stock Exchange quite literally featuring a symbolic representation of this 'bull' on Wall Street), it is justified to suggest this poem is directed at American society.","The land was there before us
Was the land. Then things
Began happening fast. Because
The bombs us have always work
Sometimes it makes me think
God must be one of us. Because
Us has saved the world. Us gave it
A particular set of regulations
Based on 1) undisputable acumen.
2) carnivorous fortunes, delicately
Referred to here as “bull market”
And (of course) other irrational factors
Deadly smoke thick over the icecaps,
Our man in Saigon Lima Tokyo etc etc",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53346/inauguration
On Being a Woman by Dorothy Parker,Dorothy Parker,"'On Being a Woman' by Dorothy Parker is a short and humorous poem about a fickle-minded lady's failure in love. In this poem, the speaker shares what she has on her mind. According to her, when she is in Rome, she feels it is better in his home. But when she returns to her native land, she starts to miss Rome. In the second stanza, the speaker refers to her beloved. She is “spectacularly bored” in this relationship. For this reason, she does not hide her feelings. She asks him to leave. Lastly, she humorously asks him whether he can return when she screams to have him back.","Why is it, when I am in Rome,
I'd give an eye to be at home,
But when on native earth I be,

And why with you, my love, my lord,
Am I spectacularly bored,
Yet do you up and leave me--then
I scream to have you back again?",https://hellopoetry.com/poem/10109/on-being-a-woman/
On the Medusa of Leonardo Da Vinci in the Florentine Gallery by Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"On the Medusa…' by Percy Bysshe Shelley describes the beautiful and terrifying gaze of Medusa and the speaker's perception of her life. The poem begins with the speaker outlining how it would feel to look at Medusa if one was able to without turning to stone. He interprets her thoughts through her shadowed gaze as being those of anguish and death. As the poem continues the speaker describes how the snakes move on her head and their skins shed, transforming them endlessly throughout time. Medusa is on a rock in the water, looking down at the smaller creatures below her. It is their mistake, coming within range of her gaze, that allows the snakes to gleam their “brazen glare.”","It lieth, gazing on the midnight sky, Upon the cloudy mountain peak supine; Below, far lands are seen tremblingly; Its horror and its beauty are divine. Upon its lips and eyelids seems to lie Loveliness like a shadow, from which shrine, Fiery and lurid, struggling underneath, The agonies of anguish and of death. Yet it is less the horror than the grace Which turns the gazer's spirit into stone;
Whereon the lineaments of that dead face Are graven, till the characters be grown Into itself, and thought no more can trace; 'Tis the melodious hue of beauty thrown Athwart the darkness and the glare of pain,
Which humanize and harmonize the strain. And from its head as from one body grow, As [ ] grass out of a watery rock, Hairs which are vipers, and they curl and flow And their long tangles in each other lock,
And with unending involutions shew Their mailed radiance, as it were to mock The torture and the death within, and saw The solid air with many a ragged jaw. And from a stone beside, a poisonous eft
Peeps idly into those Gorgonian eyes; Whilst in the air a ghastly bat, bereft Of sense, has flitted with a mad surprise Out of the cave this hideous light had cleft, And he comes hastening like a moth that hies
After a taper; and the midnight sky Flares, a light more dread than obscurity. 'Tis the tempestuous loveliness of terror; For from the serpents gleams a brazen glare Kindled by that inextricable error,
Which makes a thrilling vapour of the air Become a [ ] and ever-shifting mirror Of all the beauty and the terror there— A woman's countenance, with serpent locks, Gazing in death on heaven from those wet roc",https://poets.org/poem/medusa-leonardo-da-vinci-florentine-gallery
The Telephone Call by Fleur Adcock,Fleur Adcock,"'The Telephone Call' by Fleur Adcock is about a short telephone conversation between the poet and “Universal Lotteries”. 'The Telephone Call' by Fleur Adcock is a short and witty telephonic conversation. The poet got a call from “Universal Lotteries” and they told the poet she was one of the lucky winners. She was going to be a millionaire or multi-millionaire within no time. Naturally, she was elated. Moreover, they told the poet of “giving way to” her “emotion”. After a moment, she realized what they were talking about might be fake. That's why she told them when she would get the cheque or the money. Humorously, they answered they didn't deal with money. The experience was what they dealt in and “the line went dead”.","They asked me ‘Are you sitting down?
Right? This is Universal Lotteries’,
they said. ‘You’ve won the top prize,
the Ultra-super Global Special.
What would you do with a million pounds?
Or, actually, with more than a million –
not that it makes a lot of difference
once you’re a millionaire.’ And they laughed.

‘Are you OK?’ they asked – ‘Still there?
Come on, now, tell us, how does it feel?’
I said ‘I just…I can’t believe it!’
They said ‘That’s what they all say.
What else? Go on, tell us about it.’
I said ‘I feel the top of my head
has floated off, out through the window,
revolving like a flying saucer.’
‘That’s unusual’ they said. ‘Go on.’
I said ‘I’m finding it hard to talk.
My throat’s gone dry, my nose is tingling.
I think I’m going to sneeze – or cry.’
‘That’s right’ they said, ‘don’t be ashamed
of giving way to your emotions.
It isn’t every day you hear

May by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"'May' by Christina Rossetti describes an unknown event a speaker experienced in the warm, young, and pleasant month of May. The poem begins with the speaker outlining the setting and telling her listener that there is something important she can't tell them. This does not impede her from talking around “it.” Whatever happened to her occurred in May, in days she now recalls fondly, and with a deep longing. She loved this time period for how it sat on the edge of life. Death was so far off the month seemed without end. In the last lines, the speaker reiterates what she conveyed in the first three. She also states that now that the event is in the past, she feels cold. This is a distinct change from the warmth of the sun in the previous lines.","I cannot tell you how it was,
But this I know: it came to pass
Upon a bright and sunny day
When May was young; ah, pleasant May!
As yet the poppies were not born
Between the blades of tender corn;
The last egg had not hatched as yet,
Nor any bird foregone its mate.

I cannot tell you what it was,
But this I know: it did but pass.
It passed away with sunny May,
Like all sweet things it passed away,
And left me old, and cold, and gray.",https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/may/
The Living Temple by Oliver Wendell Holmes,Oliver Wendell Holmes,"The Living Temple' by Oliver Wendell Holmes describes the relationship the speaker sees between humankind and God's marvelous natural creation. The poem begins with the speaker describing how one could look to heaven, the earth, and within the human body and still not come to a full understanding of God's power. He speaks of the “wondrous frame” of humankind and the “Eternal wisdom” of God that lives inside it. In the next stanza he goes on to describes how humanity is intrinsically linked to the natural world. The blowing of the winds and the flowing of the rivers bring in and out life and death. They lead to and from the human heart and the “flame” that is God's power. The speaker moves on to reference a “slave” who is toiling over a body of water. The mundanity of the scene is interrupted by a “crimson jet” overhead, reminding one that God's will and power are always at play. In the final stanzas, the speaker draws the reader's attention to the sights and sounds of earth and how wonderful they are to the human ear and eye. The poem concludes with a plea for all of humanity and it's construction. The speaker hopes that God will take the dust that is left behind after death and bring it to Heaven from where it originated.","Not in the world of light alone,
Where God has built his blazing throne,
Nor yet alone in earth below,
With belted seas that come and go,
And endless isles of sunlit green,
Is all thy Maker’s glory seen:
Look in upon thy wondrous frame,—
Eternal wisdom still the same!

The smooth, soft air with pulse-like waves
Flows murmuring through its hidden caves,
Whose streams of brightening purple rush,
Fired with a new and livelier blush,
While all their burden of decay
The ebbing current steals away,
And red with Nature’s flame they start
From the warm fountains of the heart.

No rest that throbbing slave may ask,
Forever quivering o’er his task,
While far and wide a crimson jet
Leaps forth to fill the woven net
Which in unnumbered crossing tides
The flood of burning life divides,
Then, kindling each decaying part,
Creeps back to find the throbbing heart.

But warmed with that unchanging flame
Behold the outward moving frame,
Its living marbles jointed strong
With glistening band and silvery thong,
And linked to reason’s guiding reins
By myriad rings in trembling chains,
Each graven with the threaded zone
Which claims it as the master’s own.

See how yon beam of seeming white
Is braided out of seven-hued light,
Yet in those lucid globes no ray
By any chance shall break astray.
Hark how the rolling surge of sound,
Arches and spirals circling round,
Wakes the hushed spirit through thine ear
With music it is heaven to hear.

Then mark the cloven sphere that holds
All thought in its mysterious folds;
That feels sensation’s faintest thrill,
And flashes forth the sovereign will;
Think on the stormy world that dwells
Locked in its dim and clustering cells!
The lightning gleams of power it sheds
Along its hollow glassy threads!

O Father! grant thy love divine
To make these mystic temples thine!
When wasting age and wearying strife
Have sapped the leaning walls of life,
When darkness gathers over all,
And the last tottering pillars fall,
Take the poor dust thy mercy warms,
And mould it into heavenly forms!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44384/the-living-temple
The Gallery by Andrew Marvell,Andrew Marvell,"“The Gallery” by Andrew Marvell describes a mental gallery of images that a devoted speaker has painted for his object of affection, Clora. The poem begins with the speaker inviting the reader and Clora to follow him into his soul where he has created a gallery. This gallery is filled only with images of his true love, and he hopes that she will be impressed by it. The first painting that he shows off is that of Clora as a “murderess” using her looks to charm those around her. The second shows her as Aurora the goddess of the dawn. These two contrasting images depict the intensive spot that she holds in the speaker's heart. She is both a controlling and appealing woman. This is expanded on as the speaker shows the reader a portrait of Clora as Venus, as well as an “enchantress” who is telling the future from her lover's entrails. The poem concludes with the speaker saying that these are only a few of the thousands of paintings he has and that of all of them, the original is his favorite. He most cherishes an image of his love shows her as she was when he first saw her, simple, and kind.","Clora, come view my soul, and tell Whether I have contrived it well. Now all its several lodgings lie Composed into one gallery;
And the great arras-hangings, made Of various faces, by are laid; That, for all furniture, you’ll find Only your picture in my mind.
Here thou are painted in the dress
Of an inhuman murderess; Examining upon our hearts Thy fertile shop of cruel arts: Engines more keen than ever yet Adorned a tyrant’s cabinet;
Of which the most tormenting are
Black eyes, red lips, and curlèd hair.
But, on the other side, th’art drawn Like to Aurora in the dawn;
When in the East she slumbering lies, And stretches out her milky thighs; While all the morning choir does sing, And manna falls, and roses spring; And, at thy feet, the wooing doves Sit pérfecting their harmless loves.
Like an enchantress here thou show’st, Vexing thy restless lover’s ghost; And, by a light obscure, dost rave Over his entrails, in the cave; Divining thence, with horrid care, How long thou shalt continue fair;
And (when informed) them throw’st away,
To be the greedy vulture’s prey.
But, against that, thou sit’st afloat Like Venus in her pearly boat.
The halcyons, calming all that’s nigh, Betwixt the air and water fly; Or, if some rolling wave appears, A mass of ambergris it bears.
Nor blows more wind than what may well Convoy the perfume to the smell.
These pictures and a thousand more
Of thee my gallery do store
In all the forms thou canst invent Either to please me, or torment: For thou alone to people me, Art grown a numerous colony; And a collection choicer far
Than or Whitehall’s or Mantua’s were.
But, of these pictures and the rest,
That at the entrance likes me best: Where the same posture, and the look Remains, with which I first was took: A tender shepherdess, whose hair
Hangs loosely playing in the air, Transplanting flowers from the green hill, To crown her head, and bosom fill.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48326/the-gallery
Poetry by Marianne Moore,Marianne Moore,"Poetry' by Marianne Moore is a three-line poem in which the speaker, who is likely Moore herself, discusses her feelings about poetry. In the first line, she states quite bluntly that she “too” dislikes poetry. Readers must make the leap, connecting “it” in this line to the title, 'Poetry'. She goes on, revises her statement, and adding that she does get something out of reading it. She states that it is a place for “genuine” to reside.","I too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in
it after all, a place for the genuine.
Hands that can grasp, eyes
that can dilate, hair that can rise
if it must, these things are important not because a
high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
useful; when they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the
same thing may be said for all of us—that we
do not admire what
we cannot understand. The bat,
holding on upside down or in quest of something to
eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
a tree, the immovable critic twinkling his skin like a horse that feels a flea, the base—
ball fan, the statistician—case after case
could be cited did
one wish it; nor is it valid
to discriminate against “business documents and
school-books”; all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry,
nor till the autocrats among us can be
“literalists of
the imagination”—above
insolence and triviality and can present
for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have
it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, in defiance of their opinion—
the raw material of poetry in
all its rawness, and
that which is on the other hand,
genuine, then you are interested in poetry.",https://poets.org/poem/poetry
When I Die by Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi,Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi,"'When I Die' by Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi meditates wholly upon eternity after the mortal death and the new “dawn” after the darkest night in life. In this poem, Rumi expresses his antithetical ideas and how he wants his loved ones to react after he passes away. He has a positive attitude throughout the poem, though he talks about his death. The poem contains many symbols that explain the speaker's thoughts on death. It is considered that death is nothing but an “arriving at eternal love.” For the speaker, death is a doorway to heaven and eternal life waiting behind the thin veil of oblivion. It helps one to be the closest with God. Besides, the poem reflects Islamic concepts and beliefs of eternal life. According to the speaker, death appears to be like a “sunset,” but actually, it is the “dawn.”","When I die
when my coffin
is being taken out
you must never think
i am missing this world

don't shed any tears
don't lament or
feel sorry
i'm not falling
into a monster's abyss

when you see
my corpse is being carried
don't cry for my leaving
i'm not leaving
i'm arriving at eternal love

when you leave me
in the grave
don't say goodbye
remember a grave is
only a curtain
for the paradise behind

you'll only see me
descending into a grave
now watch me rise
how can there be an end
when the sun sets or
the moon goes down

it looks like the end
it seems like a sunset
but in reality it is a dawn
when the grave locks you up
that is when your soul is freed

have you ever seen
a seed fallen to earth
not rise with a new life
why should you doubt the rise
of a seed named human

have you ever seen
a bucket lowered into a well
coming back empty
why lament for a soul
when it can come back
like Joseph from the well

when for the last time
you close your mouth
your words and soul
will belong to the world of
no place no time",https://allpoetry.com/poem/14327689-When-I-Die-by-Mewlana-Jalaluddin-Rumi
"Stanzas Written in Dejection, near Naples by Percy Bysshe Shelley",Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Stanzas Written in Dejection, near Naples' by Percy Bysshe Shelley describes the feelings of alienation a speaker suffers from and how he attempts to soothe his pain with nature. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he is observing a beautiful day. The landscape around him contains both the sea and mountains and he is able to take in both. He observes everything, listening to its voice which sounds like “Solitude's.” In the next section, he looks deeper into the sea and sees the bottom of the deep. It is untouched by any human presence. Once more the elements of the scene come together and show off the true beauty of the landscape. He is there at a pristine moment in time. The next sections go into the emotional state of the narrator. He is not enlivened by the sights he sees. Instead, he meditates on his own depression. He lists all the things he does not have but wishes he did. This has led him into a dark place in his mind he cannot get out of. He feels as if the world does not care for him— he is a man alone. The final section sees the speaker attempt to improve his own mood by enjoying the moment he is living in. He understands how time passes and that this moment, if not enjoyed will go to waste just like all the others he took for granted.","The sun is warm, the sky is clear,
The waves are dancing fast and bright,
Blue isles and snowy mountains wear
The purple noon's transparent might,
The breath of the moist earth is light,
Around its unexpanded buds;
Like many a voice of one delight,
The winds, the birds, the ocean floods,
The City's voice itself, is soft like Solitude's.
I see the Deep's untrampled floor
With green and purple seaweeds strown;
I see the waves upon the shore,
Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown:
I sit upon the sands alone,—
The lightning of the noontide ocean
Is flashing round me, and a tone
Arises from its measured motion,
How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion.
Alas! I have nor hope nor health,
Nor peace within nor calm around,
Nor that content surpassing wealth
The sage in meditation found,
And walked with inward glory crowned—
Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor leisure.
Others I see whom these surround—
Smiling they live, and call life pleasure;
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure.
Yet now despair itself is mild,
Even as the winds and waters are;
I could lie down like a tired child,
And weep away the life of care
Which I have borne and yet must bear,
Till death like sleep might steal on me,
And I might feel in the warm air
My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.
Some might lament that I were cold,
As I, when this sweet day is gone,
Which my lost heart, too soon grown old,
Insults with this untimely moan;
They might lament—for I am one
Whom men love not,—and yet regret,
Unlike this day, which, when the sun
Shall on its stainless glory set,
Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45140/stanzas-written-in-dejection-near-naples

The Man from Snowy River by Banjo Paterson,Banjo Paterson,"'The Man from Snowy River' by Banjo Paterson is a Bush Ballad, that tells the story of a young man who single-handedly pursues a prizewinning colt and brings back the mob of wild horses. 'The Man from Snowy River,' tells the story of a prizewinning racehorse that escapes from its paddock and lives with the wild horses. Following this, a number of horsemen go on a pursuit to bring back the colt. Unexpectedly, the brumbies descend a seemingly impassable steep slope. Even though other riders give up the pursuit, a young protagonist, the man from the snowy river goes down the “terrible descent” to recapture the colt on his “pony”. Without minding the danger that he catches the mob and brings back the horse and becomes the legend among the people of the country.","There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around
That the colt from Old Regret had got away,
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,
And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,
The old man with his hair as white as snow;
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up —
He would go wherever horse and man could go.
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,
No better horseman ever held the reins;
For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,
He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast;
He was something like a racehorse undersized,
With a touch of Timor pony — three parts thoroughbred at least —
And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.
He was hard and tough and wiry — just the sort that won't say die —
There was courage in his quick impatient tread;
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,
And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.
But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,
And the old man said, ""That horse will never do
For a long and tiring gallop - lad, you'd better stop away,
Those hills are far too rough for such as you.""
So he waited sad and wistful — only Clancy stood his friend —
""I think we ought to let him come,"" he said;
""I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,
For both his horse and he are mountain bred.""
""He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,
Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,
Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,
The man that holds his own is good enough.
And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,
Where the river runs those giant hills between;
I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,
But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.""
So he went; they found the horses by the big mimosa clump,
They raced away towards the mountain's brow,
And the old man gave his orders, ""Boys, go at them from the jump,
No use to try for fancy riding now.
And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.
Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,
For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,
If once they gain the shelter of those hills.""
So Clancy rode to wheel them — he was racing on the wing
Where the best and boldest riders take their place,
And he raced his stockhorse past them, and he made the ranges ring
With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.
Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,
But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,
And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,
And off into the mountain scrub they flew.
Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black
Resounded to the thunder of their tread,
And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back
From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.
And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,
Where Mountain Ash and Kurrajong grew wide;
And the old man muttered fiercely, ""We may bid the mob good day,
No man can hold them down the other side.""
When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull -
It well might make the boldest hold their breath;
The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full
Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.
But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,
And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,
And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,
While the others stood and watched in very fear.
He sent the flint-stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,
He cleared the fallen timbers in his stride,
And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat —
It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.
Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,
Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;
And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,
At the bottom of that terrible descent.
He was right among the horses as they climbed the farther hill
And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,
Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely; he was right among them still,
As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.
Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met
In the ranges - but a final glimpse reveals
On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,
With the man from Snowy River at their heels.
And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.
He followed like a bloodhound on their track,
Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,
And alone and unassisted brought them back.
But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,
He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;
But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,
For never yet was mountain horse a cur.
And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise
Their torn and rugged battlements on high,
Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze
At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,
And where around the Overflow the reed -beds sweep and sway
To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,
The man from Snowy River is a household word today,
And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.",https://allpoetry.com/The-Man-from-Snowy-River
"Thee, Thee, Only Thee by Thomas Moore",Thomas Moore,"Thee, Thee, Only Thee' by Thomas Moore describes the state of a speaker's life as he obsesses over a woman he loves. The poem begins with the speaker stating that whenever he wakes up, no matter how beautiful the day, or promising the engagements, he is unhappy. There is a “dark spot” inside his soul which cannot be filled by anyone— other than the woman he loves. She is transforming his life bit by bit. By this point, he has become overwhelmed by his love. It is bordering on obsession. He speaks on how he used to care about his own “fame.” This used to be the goal of the path he was walking on. That has completely changed at this point though. She has taken him over. In the final stanza, he speaks on how his life is passing him by and that the woman he loves is the only one who can break the spell he is under. Until they come together he will live with the “dark spot” inside his heart and soul.","The dawning of morn, the daylight's sinking,
The night's long hours still find me thinking
Of thee, thee, only thee.
When friends are met, and goblets crown'd,
And smiles are near, that once enchanted,
Unreach'd by all that sunshine round,
My soul, like some dark spot, is haunted
By thee, thee, only thee.

Whatever in fame's high path could waken
My spirit once, is now forsaken
For thee, thee, only thee.
Like shores, by which some headlong bark
To the ocean hurries, resting never,
Life's scenes go by me, bright or dark,
I know not, heed not, hastening ever
To thee, thee, only thee.

I have not a joy but of thy bringing,
And pain itself seems sweet when springing
From thee, thee, only thee.
Like spells, that nought on earth can break,
Till lips, that know the charm, have spoken,
This heart, howe'er the world may wake
Its grief, its scorn, can but be broken
By thee, thee, only thee.",poemhunter.com/poem/thee-thee-only-thee/
Red Roses by Anne Sexton,Anne Sexton,"Red Roses by Anne Sexton is a story of child abuse told by a narrator, but with the vernacular, that represents the emotions and thoughts of the child undergoing the abuse. The word choice and imagery is so contrary to the negative phrasing a reader might expect in a story of a toddler being abused that the atmosphere of the work feels like a juxtaposition. This juxtaposition, as it happens, is one of the primary strengths of the work because it showcases the struggle of a child who loves his mother and wants to stay with her, but needs to make the situation right enough in his own mind to keep going with that love. Little Tommy, the toddler, wants to believe that things are well with his mother, though he seems to know better on a deeper level, and that concept is a driving force in the work—to the point that Sexton’s poem is sincerely haunting and heart-breaking.","Tommy is three and when he's bad
his mother dances with him.
She puts on the record,
""Red Roses for a Blue Lady""
and throws him across the room.
Mind you,
she never laid a hand on him.
He gets red roses in different places,
the head, that time he was as sleepy as a river,
the back, that time he was a broken scarecrow,
the arm like a diamond had bitten it,
the leg, twisted like a licorice stick,
all the dance they did together,
Blue Lady and Tommy.
You fell, she said, just remember you fell.
I fell, is all he told the doctors
in the big hospital. A nice lady came
and asked him questions but because
he didn't want to be sent away he said, I fell.
He never said anything else although he could talk fine.
He never told about the music
or how she'd sing and shout
holding him up and throwing him.

He pretends he is her ball.
He tries to fold up and bounce
but he squashes like fruit.
For he loves Blue Lady and the spots
of red roses he gives her",http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/anne_sexton/poems/18172
The Visionary by Emily Brontë,Emily Brontë,"The Visionary' by Emily Brontë (and, to some extent, Charlotte Brontë) describes the imminent arrival of an undefined, spirit-like presence to a house in the middle of winter. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she is the only one still awake in the house. The “sire” and the “dame” are asleep. They cannot see what she's doing and even if they did, she'd reveal nothing about her intentions. There is someone she's waiting for and her lamp, that she tends assiduously, is there in the window guiding this person in. By the end of the poem it becomes clear that this visitor is nonhuman. He has a “Strange Power” and the ability to command her allegiance. He holds all the power in the relationship and she is determined to be true to him and keep his identity a secret from everyone. This is what's going to maintain their relationship. Although the full poem is quoted below, you can also read the poem here.","Silent is the house: all are laid asleep:
One alone looks out o’er the snow-wreaths deep,
Watching every cloud, dreading every breeze
That whirls the wildering drift, and bends the groaning trees.

Cheerful is the hearth, soft the matted floor;
Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door;
The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot strong and far:
I trim it well, to be the wanderer’s guiding-star.

Frown, my haughty sire! chide, my angry dame!
Set your slaves to spy; threaten me with shame:
But neither sire nor dame nor prying serf shall know,
What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow.

What I love shall come like visitant of air,
Safe in secret power from lurking human snare;
What loves me, no word of mine shall e’er betray,
Though for faith unstained my life must forfeit pay.

Burn, then, little lamp; glimmer straight and clear—
Hush! a rustling wing stirs, methinks, the air:
He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me;
Strange Power! I trust thy might; trust thou my constancy.",https://poets.org/poem/visionary
Mistaken by Vikram Seth,Vikram Seth,"Mistaken' by Vikram Seth speaks on the nature of relationships and how couples come to learn more about one another as those relationships develop. The poem is simple, with only eight lines it outlines quickly and clearly the first time the two met, the relationship they thought they had, and how that turned out not to be the case. Whoever the speaker and listener are, they did not truly know one another. It becomes clear that they had misunderstood who the other person was and built their relationship on false pretenses.","I smiled at you because I thought that you
Were someone else; you smiled back; and there grew
Between two strangers in a library
Something that seemes like love; but you loved me
(If that's the word) because you thought that I
Was other than I was. And by and by
We found we'd been mistaken all the while
From that first glance, that first mistaken smile.",poemhunter.com/poem/mistaken-23/
Funeral Blues by W.H. Auden,W.H. Auden,"Funeral Blues' by W.H. Auden is about the power of grief and the way that it influences people differently. For someone like the speaker who has suffered a loss, the world is transformed. But to everyone else, nothing changes. Time doesn't slow down, and no one cares what's happening. The indifference of the world plagues the speaker in this poem. They plead with the world to feel as they do, understand his grief, and even participate in it.","Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;

Two Lovers and a Beachcomber by the Real Sea by Sylvia Plath,Sylvia Plath,"This poem takes place almost entirely in an imagined world within the speaker's head. Her “summer house” which she imagines, is a place in which she and her lover were going to be happy. This place of carefree happiness is being sealed up, windows covered and the view gone. Their time has dwindled like the sand in an hourglass. The speaker remembers how fanciful and free her thoughts used to be and that now they have retreated to the back of her head. She speaks of the nature of their relationship and how there is no way to predict what the two of them are becoming and that they are akin to white whales, gone far out in the ocean. The speaker continues on to describe her own consciousness as a beachcomber searching through her memories for something worthwhile while seagulls circle above. The poem concludes with a reality check in which she states permanent facts about the world, repeating them to herself, forcing herself to acknowledge reality and leave behind her fantasy world.","Cold and final, the imagination
Shuts down its fabled summer house;
Blue views are boarded up; our sweet vacation
Dwindles in the hour-glass.

Thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair
Tangling in the tide's green fall
Now fold their wings like bats and disappear
Into the attic of the skull.

We are not what we might be; what we are
Outlaws all extrapolation
Beyond the interval of now and here:
White whales are gone with the white ocean.

A lone beachcomber squats among the wrack
Of kaleidoscope shells
Probing fractured Venus with a stick
Under a tent of taunting gulls.

No sea-change decks the sunken shank of bone
That chucks in backtrack of the wave;
Though the mind like an oyster labors on and on,
A grain of sand is all we have.

Water will run by; the actual sun
Will scrupulously rise and set;
No little man lives in the exacting moon
And that is that, is that, is that.",https://allpoetry.com/Two-Lovers-And-A-Beachcomber-By-The-Real-Sea
Sonnet Of The Sweet Complaint by Federico Garcia Lorca,Federico Garcia Lorca,"Sonnet Of The Sweet Complaint' by Federico Garcia Lorca describes the freeing and revelatory love experienced between a speaker and his listener. The poem begins with the speaker asking that no matter what happens the love between himself and another is never be lost. He wants to be able to relish his lover's eyes and breath on his “cheek” every night. The speaker is worried about losing what he has because he imagines himself as a tree without adornments on a solitary shore. This is not how he wants to live the rest of his life. In the last two stanzas, the speaker directs his words to his lover. This person has become so important to him that they have taken on the role of “master.” He is a “dog,” following and indulging his lover's every desire.","Never let me lose the marvel
of your statue-like eyes, or the accent
the solitary rose of your breath
places on my cheek at night.

 I am afraid of being, on this shore,
a branchless trunk, and what I most regret
is having no flower, pulp, or clay
for the worm of my despair.

 If you are my hidden treasure,
if you are my cross, my dampened pain,
if I am a dog, and you alone my master,

 never let me lose what I have gained,
and adorn the branches of your river
with leaves of my estranged Autumn.",https://allpoetry.com/Sonnet-Of-The-Sweet-Complaint
On Seeing the Elgin Marbles by John Keats,John Keats,"'On Seeing the Elgin Marbles' by John Keats discusses human mortality while describing the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum. The speaker starts the poem by asserting that their spirit isn't strong enough; they are weighed down by the inevitability of death. SO much so, it feels as though they are about to fall asleep at any time. They look at the states of godlike hardship, and they know that they are going to lose their life one day. The speaker makes other comparisons, suggesting that they are like an eagle that is too sick to fly, but that gazes at the sky. They also say that these thoughts make the speaker hone in on the struggle in their heart. This is compared to the way that the Elgin Marbles make the speaker feel awestruck and in pain. They are filled with both beauty and suffering. They make the speaker, he concludes, think of the sea and sun, but at the same time, they are shadows of something else entirely.","My spirit is too weak—mortality
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
Yet ’tis a gentle luxury to weep
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep
Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye.
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
Wasting of old time—with a billowy main—
A sun—a shadow of a magnitude.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52305/on-seeing-the-elgin-marbles
The Wild Iris by Louise Glück,Louise Glück,"The Wild Iris' by Louise Glück is a complex and deeply metaphorical poem that describes death from the perspective of a flower. Throughout the short lines of 'The Wild Iris,' the speaker describes what it means to live, die, and be reborn again. They've gone through the cycle an endless number of times as a flower. It is a struggle that has a door at the end, a light at the end of the tunnel. They are well-versed in what it is like to be buried alive and exist without a voice and then rediscover that voice as one bends the earth. While the speaker is talking about a flower, there are obvious implications for humanity, and the human soul. It is also possible to read this poem as a depiction of a mental or emotional rebirth rather than a physical one.","At the end of my suffering
there was a door.

Hear me out: that which you call death
I remember.

Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.
Then nothing. The weak sun
flickered over the dry surface.

It is terrible to survive
as consciousness
buried in the dark earth.

Then it was over: that which you fear, being
a soul and unable
to speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth
bending a little. And what I took to be
birds darting in low shrubs.

You who do not remember
passage from the other world
I tell you I could speak again: whatever
returns from oblivion returns
to find a voice:

from the center of my life came
a great fountain, deep blue
shadows on azure seawater.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-wild-iris/
The Promise by Jane Hirshfield,Jane Hirshfield,"The Promise by Jane Hirshfield is a reflection on how things in the poet’s life seem to drift away from her, leaving her behind. She asks objects such as ‘flowers’, a ‘spider’ and even her own ‘body’ to stay, but in the end they always leave or change. The final stanza of the poem focuses on asking lovers to stay, to which they answer ‘always’. This ending can be interpreted both positivity, in that they stay with her, or as a lie – a broken promise repeated lover after lover.","Stay, I said
to the cut flowers.
They bowed
their heads lower.

Stay, I said to the spider,
who fled.

Stay, leaf.
It reddened,
embarrassed for me and itself.

Stay, I said to my body.
It sat as a dog does,
obedient for a moment,
soon starting to tremble.

Stay, to the earth
of riverine valley meadows,
of fossiled escarpments,
of limestone and sandstone.
It looked back
with a changing expression, in silence.

Stay, I said to my loves.
Each answered,
Always.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55584/the-promise-56d23752834aa
Christmas by John Betjeman,John Betjeman,"'Christmas' by John Betjeman describes the traditions of Christmas time and how they compare to the story of the birth of Christ. The poem begins with the speaker describing the lead up to Christmas and how everything in a church is decorated for Advent. These images start the poem on a cozy and familiar note. The speaker's tone is calm and peaceful, he is simply taking in the Christmas imagery. Time progresses, and the speaker moves on to examine the village itself. There are a number of buildings which are also decorated with “paper” and buntings that read “Merry Christmas to you all.” The next lines move the poem into London. There, the speaker takes note of the shops which are also decorated. They are adorned with “silver bells and flowers. This contrasts somewhat with the simple decorations of the village. In the fifth stanza, he goes through a few of the people who are called to the church on Christmas Eve. They all come, even those who live in the “Dorchester Hotel.” Stanzas six and seven contain questions. They are used to seek out the truth of the Christian Christmas story, regarding the birth of Christ in a manger. It is clear from the speaker's tone that he is already a believer, he is just using the questions as a place to start off this last section of the poem. Throughout stanzas seven and eight he compares the things that people do on Christmas, such as giving bad gifts and spending time with family to what he thinks really matters. That is the birth of Christ and giving proper time and appreciation to the story.","The bells of waiting Advent ring,
The Tortoise stove is lit again
And lamp-oil light across the night
Has caught the streaks of winter rain
In many a stained-glass window sheen
From Crimson Lake to Hookers Green.
The holly in the windy hedge
And round the Manor House the yew
Will soon be stripped to deck the ledge,
The altar, font and arch and pew,
So that the villagers can say
'The church looks nice' on Christmas Day.
Provincial Public Houses blaze,
Corporation tramcars clang,
On lighted tenements I gaze,
Where paper decorations hang,
And bunting in the red Town Hall
Says 'Merry Christmas to you all'.
And London shops on Christmas Eve
Are strung with silver bells and flowers
As hurrying clerks the City leave
To pigeon-haunted classic towers,
And marbled clouds go scudding by
The many-steepled London sky.
And girls in slacks remember Dad,
And oafish louts remember Mum,
And sleepless children's hearts are glad.
And Christmas-morning bells say 'Come!'
Even to shining ones who dwell
Safe in the Dorchester Hotel.
And is it true? And is it true,
This most tremendous tale of all,
Seen in a stained-glass window's hue,
A Baby in an ox's stall ?
The Maker of the stars and sea
Become a Child on earth for me ?
And is it true ? For if it is,
No loving fingers tying strings
Around those tissued fripperies,
The sweet and silly Christmas things,
Bath salts and inexpensive scent
And hideous tie so kindly meant,
No love that in a family dwells,
No carolling in frosty air,
Nor all the steeple-shaking bells
Can with this single Truth compare -
That God was man in Palestine
And lives today in Bread and Wine.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8493411-Christmas-by-Sir-John-Betjeman
"If I were loved, as I desire to be by Lord Alfred Tennyson",Alfred Lord Tennyson,"“If I were loved, as I desire to be” by Alfred Lord Tennyson is a sonnet that describes how the speaker's life would be different if he was loved the way he wants to be. The poem beings with the speaker stating that he does not have the amount, or type, of love that he desires. He wants to be loved without reserve or stipulation. He believes that if he can acquire the love of one particular unnamed person, that he will be without fear. The evil of the world will be unable to reach him. The speaker describes how all the pain that exists, whether within or without, could not touch him. He would be impervious to hurt of any kind. Love would provide him with an indestructible hope that would rise past any depression or darkness. The poem concludes with the speaker describing how even if the world was to completely come to an end, and alone with her he faced his death, he would not be afraid. As long as they have their hands clasped and are able to reassure one another with their presence, they could face an oncoming torrent of destruction. Unfortunately for the speaker, this is only a dream. From this piece, the reader cannot infer whether there is any possibility of this love becoming real.","If I were loved, as I desire to be,
What is there in the great sphere of the earth,
And range of evil between death and birth,
That I should fear, —if I were loved by thee?
All the inner, all the outer world of pain
Clear Love would pierce and cleave, if thou wert mine
As I have heard that, somewhere in the main,
Fresh-water springs come up through bitter brine.
'T were joy, not fear, claspt hand-in-hand with thee,
To wait for death--mute--careless of all ills,
Apart upon a mountain, tho' the surge
Of some new deluge from a thousand hills
Flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge
Below us, as far on as eye could see.",https://genius.com/Alfred-lord-tennyson-if-i-were-loved-as-i-desire-to-be-annotated
Quinceañera by Judith Ortiz Cofer,Judith Ortiz Cofer,"'Quinceañera' by Judith Ortiz Cofer is about a girl who copes up with the reaction of her family and her own bodily changes after reaching puberty. This heartfelt poem captures a girl's reaction when she steps into womanhood. Several changes occur in her life that makes her soul troubled. She finds herself caged inside a body that is portrayed as “impure” to society. Furthermore, Cofer captures her intimate feelings about the painful changes within her body. The child has to tackle the transition on her own. None consoles her instead they burden her body with womanly modifications.","My dolls have been put away like dead
children in a chest I will carry
with me when I marry.
I reach under my skirt to feel
a satin slip bought for this day. It is soft
as the inside of my thighs. My hair
has been nailed back with my mother’s
black hairpins to my skull. Her hands
stretched my eyes open as she twisted
braids into a tight circle at the nape
of my neck. I am to wash my own clothes
and sheets from this day on, as if
the fluids of my body were poison, as if
the little trickle of blood I believe
travels from my heart to the world were
shameful. Is not the blood of saints and
men in battle beautiful? Do Christ’s hands
not bleed into your eyes from His cross?
At night I hear myself growing and wake
to find my hands drifting of their own will
to soothe skin stretched tight
over my bones,
I am wound like the guts of a clock,
waiting for each hour to release me.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57812/quincenanera
Lament for Thomas MacDonagh by Francis Ledwidge,Francis Ledwidge,"Poetic Form A lament is a song of grief for the dead. It is an old poetic form, with roots in a religious ritual. The Book of Lamentations, for example, is one of the books of the Old Testament. In Irish, there are several great lamentations, such as “Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill,” “The Hag of Beare,” and “Lament for Art O'Leary.” The rhyme scheme of Lament for Thomas MacDonagh is Xaba bcXc Xbab and the meter is iambic tetrameter. The last word of the first line in each stanza rhymes with the middle word of the second line of each stanza: 1) cry/sky, 2) blows/snows, and 3) moor/poor. In stanzas two and three, Ledwidge repeats this pattern with the third and fourth lines: cup/upset, morn/horn. Ledwidge makes use of “eye rhyme,” in the poem, a form of writing where two words look as though they should rhyme, even though they do not. An example is “cow” and “low” in stanza three. In the first stanza “sweeter birds” contains elements of the word “bittern” (bi-, -ter) and the false rhymes of “wailing” and “rain.”","HE SHALL not hear the bittern cry

In the wild sky, where he is lain,

Nor voices of the sweeter birds,

Above the wailing of the rain.

Nor shall he know when loud March blows

Thro’ slanting snows her fanfare shrill,

Blowing to flame the golden cup

Of many an upset daffodil.

But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor,

And pastures poor with greedy weeds,

Perhaps he’ll hear her low at morn,

Lifting her horn in pleasant meads.",https://www.bartleby.com/lit-hub/anthology-of-irish-verse/122-lament-for-thomas-macdonagh/
Indian Boarding School: The Runaways by Louise Erdrich,Louise Erdrich,"'Indian Boarding School: The Runaways' by Louise Erdrich is a powerful poem that describes runaways from an Indian Boarding School. The poem is part dream and part reality. The young speaker describes a failed effort to escape from the boarding school. It starts with the children jumping on a train and briefly riding it. They look outside and admire the landscape, noting how scarred and changed it is. When they get to a stopping point, the sheriff picks them up and returns them. This is something, the speaker alludes, that has happened before and will likely happen again. Back at the school, they do “shameful” work and consider their ancestors. Despite what they've suffered, there is still hope in their hearts, keeping them strong.","Home’s the place we head for in our sleep. Boxcars stumbling north in dreams
don’t wait for us. We catch them on the run. The rails, old lacerations that we love, shoot parallel across the face and break just under Turtle Mountains. Riding scars
you can’t get lost. Home is the place they cross.
The lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark less tolerant. We watch through cracks in boards as the land starts rolling, rolling till it hurts to be here, cold in regulation clothes.
We know the sheriff’s waiting at midrun
to take us back. His car is dumb and warm.
The highway doesn’t rock, it only hums
like a wing of long insults. The worn-down welts of ancient punishments lead back and forth.
All runaways wear dresses, long green ones,
the color you would think shame was. We scrub the sidewalks down because it's shameful work. Our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear
a moment, things us kids pressed on the dark face before it hardened, pale, remembering
delicate old injuries, the spines of names and leaves.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43079/indian-boarding-school-the-runaways
The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"‘The Second Coming’ was William Butler Yeats’ ode to the era. Rife with Christian imagery, and pulling much inspiration from apocalyptic writing, Yeats’ ‘The Second Coming’ tries to put into words what countless people of the time felt: that it was the end of the world as they knew it and that nothing else would ever be the same again. The First World War had shaken the foundations of knowledge for many, and scarred from the knowledge of the ‘war to end all wars’, they could no longer reconcile themselves with a time before the Great War. This poem is the literary version of that: a lack of ability to think of a time before the war.","Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?",https://poemanalysis.com/william-butler-yeats/the-second-coming/
"The Night, the Porch by Mark Strand",Mark Strand,"'The Night, the Porch' by Mark Strand is a thoughtful and complex poem that discusses the nature of human existence and nature. The poem starts with contemplation of “nothing” and humanity's interaction with the natural world. As it progresses, the language gets more complicated. The speaker discusses how “us,” meaning humanity, want to see ourselves as strangers. This element of mystery is expanded as they discuss how the world was not “written with us in mind.”","To stare at nothing is to learn by heart
What all of us will be swept into, and baring oneself
To the wind is feeling the ungraspable somewhere close by.
Trees can sway or be still. Day or night can be what they wish.
What we desire, more than a season or weather, is the comfort
Of being strangers, at least to ourselves. This is the crux
Of the matter, which is why even now we seem to be waiting
For something whose appearance would be its vanishing—
The sound, say, of a few leaves falling, or just one leaf,
Or less. There is no end to what we can learn. The book out there
Tells us as much, and was never written with us in mind.",https://www.rattle.com/the-night-the-porch-by-mark-strand/
Dry-Point by Philip Larkin,Philip Larkin,"Dry-Point' by Philip Larkin speaks on the complexities of sexual encounters and the primal way humans are controlled by desire. The poem begins with the speaker describing sex as something that is both an irritant and a constant. There is no escaping it. One is forced to endure it in cycles and as frustration grows, a “bubble” appears. This bubble represents the rapid way in which emotions can change, as well as their delicate nature. The speaker goes on to describe how the bubble grows around himself and his listener. Together they become enclosed in it. Trapped with one another in a strange prison of love and lust. The only thing they can do is give in to their “Bestial” intent. In the next lines, he states that whenever he has sex, it always seems as if it is leading somewhere great, but that's never the case. He always ends up disappointed and looking at a “sad scape,” or poor emotional landscape. His bad memories of the encounters only last so long. Then he is ready to throw off the “irritant” once more. The poem concludes with the speaker thinking about a bright, bare room that has been burnt clean and emptied by the sun. This place contrasts with the dark “ashen hills” of the previous stanza. It is to this “padlocked” room the speaker would like to travel. Unfortunately for him, and for all of humanity represented by his plight, there is no way into this utopia.","Endlessly, time-honoured irritant,
A bubble is restively forming at your tip.
Burst it as fast as we can –
It will grow again until we begin dying.

Silently it inflates, till we’re enclosed
And forced to start the struggle to get out:
Bestial, intent, real.
The wet spark comes, the bright blown walls collapse,

But what sad scapes we cannot turn from then:
What ashen hills! what salted, shrunken lakes!
How leaden the ring looks,
Birmingham magic all discredited,


And how remote that bare and sunscrubbed room,
Intensely far, that padlocked cube of light
We neither define nor prove,
Where you, we dream, obtain no right of entry.",https://genius.com/Philip-larkin-dry-point-annotated
In 1492 – Columbus sailed the ocean blue,Undefined Poet,"'In 1492' (Columbus sailed the ocean blue) is famous for its opening lines and its broader description of Columbus' discovery of America. In the first lines of 'In 1492' (Columbus sailed the ocean blue), the speaker begins with the lines that most American schoolchildren learn in order to remember the date that Columbus first stumbled upon the New World. The stanzas go on to describe the ships that arrived there, Columbus and his crew's joy upon finding “Indians” and their meeting with the “Arakawa” natives.","IN 1492
In fourteen hundred ninety-two
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
He had three ships and left from Spain;
He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.
He sailed by night; he sailed by day;
He used the stars to find his way.
A compass also helped him know
How to find the way to go.
Ninety sailors were on board;
Some men worked while others snored.
Then the workers went to sleep;
And others watched the ocean deep.
Day after day they looked for land;
They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand.
October 12 their dream came true,
You never saw a happier crew!
""Indians! Indians!"" Columbus cried;
His heart was filled with joyful pride.
But ""India"" the land was not;
It was the Bahamas, and it was hot.
The Arakawa natives were very nice;
They gave the sailors food and spice.
Columbus sailed on to find some gold
To bring back home, as he'd been told.
He made the trip again and again,
Trading gold to bring to Spain.
The first American? No, not quite.
But Columbus was brave, and he was bright.

The Camel’s Hump by Rudyard Kipling,Rudyard Kipling,"'The Camel's Hump' by Rudyard Kipling is a fun verse on the consequences of laziness that is growing a “Cameelious hump” on our backs. In the poem 'The Camel's Hump,' Kipling draws similarities between lazy humans and a camel. The camel's hump has been taken into a negative light, calling it “uglier” to sight. Its hump is seen as a metaphor for being inactive and sluggish. Doing nothing is a sheer waste of time and energy. According to the poet, the person who sits back doing nothing productive is unpleasant to the sight, just like the “Cameelious hump.” The poet thus conveys the message to be active, involved in things, be innovative, and never stop to make oneself better and the best.","The Camel's hump is an ugly lump
Which well you may see at the Zoo;
But uglier yet is the hump we get
From having too little to do.
Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,
We get the hump—
Cameelious hump—
The hump that is black and blue!
We climb out of bed with a frouzly head,
And a snarly-yarly voice. We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
At our bath and our boots and our toys;
And there ought to be a corner for me
(And I know' there is one for you)
When we get the hump—
Cameelious hump—
The hump that is black and blue!
The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
Or frowst with a book by the fire;
But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
And dig till you gently perspire;
And then you will find that the sun and the wind,
And the Djinn of the Garden too,
Have lifted the hump—
The horrible hump—
The hump that is black and blue!
I get it as well as you-oo-oo
If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo!
We all get hump—
Cameelious hump—
Kiddies and grown-ups too!",kiplingsociety.co.uk/poem/poems_hump.htm
Giant Decorative Dahlias by Molly Holden,Molly Holden,"'Giant Decorative Dahlias' by Molly Holden describes an impossible relationship between two speakers through a conceit comparing the woman to a dahlia. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the woman is “a mighty monarch's child”. This references a higher being, perhaps God, a king, or the power of the natural world, which one cannot control. They are together under a tree, in a natural setting. The speaker held “The maiden” to their “panting breast.” In the second stanza, the speaker tells the woman that he intends to “have” her, but doesn't want any part of the woman's father's kingdom. He does not want to be king, have land, or wear a crown. The poem concludes with the woman having her say. She tells her partner that this is impossible. The only time they can be together is when she breaks through “the sod.” Here it becomes clear how Holden is using the flower to symbolize the temporary, yet strong nature of their love. The woman blooms, and then dies. In fact, she states that she is already dead, emphasizing the impossibility of their relationship.","It was a mighty monarch's child,
Her cheek was pale, her eye was wild;
Beneath a linden's shade I press'd
The maiden to my panting breast.

"" I will not have thy father's throne,
I will not have his golden crown,
I will not have his realm so wide,
I will have thee, and nought beside. ""

"" That cannot be, "" the maiden said,
"" Because I am already dead;
And but by night the sods above
I burst for thee, and thy dear love. """,https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/giant-decorative-dahlias
Missing My Daughter by Stephen Spender,Stephen Spender,"'Missing My Daughter' by Stephen Spender conveys a speaker's loneliness and desire to see his daughter. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker describes his nearly empty surroundings and how the wallpaper rises in his mind like the bars of a jail cell. These bars prevent him from being able to write, despite the piece of paper in front of him. They come from deep internal loneliness. The speaker dearly misses his daughter, who, the poem suggests, is now too old to spend time around him.","This wall-paper has lines that rise
Upright like bars, and overhead,
The ceiling's patterned with red roses.
On the wall opposite the bed
The staring looking-glass encloses
Six roses in its white of eyes.
 
Here at my desk, with note-book open
Missing my daughter, makes those bars
Draw their lines upward through my mind.
This blank page stares at me like glass
Where stared-at roses wish to pass
Through petalling of my pen.
 
An hour ago, there came an image
Of a beast that pressed its muzzle
Between bars. Next, through tick and tock
Of the reiterating clock
A second glared with the wide dazzle
Of deserts. The door, in a green mirage,
 
Opened. In my daughter came.
Her eyes were wide as those she has,
The round gaze of her childhood was
White as the distance in the glass
Or on a white page, a white poem.
The roses raced around her name.","babelmatrix.org/works/en/Spender,_Stephen-1909/Missing_My_Daughter"
The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket by Robert Lowell,Robert Lowell,"The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket' by Robert Lowell is a very complex and allusion-heavy poem that describes the sea, divine force, and corruption. Throughout the seven sections of the poem, the poet depicts the power of the ocean and humanity's inability to exert any kind of control over it. This is seen through the life and death of Ahab's crew, the explosion at sea of a special naval vessel in the first lines, as well as the various images of the waves and wind, scattered throughout the lines. The poet also brings in images of a graveyard that acts as a memorial site for many of the men who died at sea. There are numerous allusions to God and religion throughout. These include passages from the Bible.","Let man have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and the beasts of the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.

The sea was still breaking violently and night Had steamed into our North Atlantic Fleet,
When the drowned sailor clutched the drag-net. Light Flashed from his matted head and marble feet, He grappled at the net
With the coiled, hurdling muscles of his thighs:
The corpse was bloodless, a botch of reds and whites, Its open, staring eyes
Were lustreless dead-lights
Or cabin-windows on a stranded hulk Heavy with sand. We weight the body, close Its eyes and heave it seaward whence it came, Where the heel-headed dogfish barks its nose On Ahab’s void and forehead; and the name Is blocked in yellow chalk.
Sailors, who pitch this portent at the sea Where dreadnaughts shall confess
Its hell-bent deity,
When you are powerless
To sand-bag this Atlantic bulwark, faced
By the earth-shaker, green, unwearied, chaste In his steel scales: ask for no Orphean lute
To pluck life back. The guns of the steeled fleet Recoil and then repeat
The hoarse salute.
II
Whenever winds are moving and their breath Heaves at the roped-in bulwarks of this pier, The terns and sea-gulls tremble at your death In these home waters. Sailor, can you hear The Pequod’s sea wings, beating landward, fall Headlong and break on our Atlantic wall Off ’Sconset, where the yawing S-boats splash The bellbuoy, with ballooning spinnakers, As the entangled, screeching mainsheet clears The blocks: off Madaket, where lubbers lash The heavy surf and throw their long lead squids For blue-fish? Sea-gulls blink their heavy lids Seaward. The winds’ wings beat upon the stones, Cousin, and scream for you and the claws rush At the sea’s throat and wring it in the slush Of this old Quaker graveyard where the bones Cry out in the long night for the hurt beast Bobbing by Ahab’s whaleboats in the East.
III
All you recovered from Poseidon died
With you, my cousin, and the harrowed brine Is fruitless on the blue beard of the god, Stretching beyond us to the castles in Spain, Nantucket’s westward haven. To Cape Cod Guns, cradled on the tide,
Blast the eelgrass about a waterclock
Of bilge and backwash, roil the salt and sand Lashing earth’s scaffold, rock
Our warships in the hand
Of the great God, where time’s contrition blues Whatever it was these Quaker sailors lost
In the mad scramble of their lives. They died When time was open-eyed,
Wooden and childish; only bones abide
There, in the nowhere, where their boats were tossed Sky-high, where mariners had fabled news Of IS, the whited monster. What it cost Them is their secret. In the sperm-whale’s slick I see the Quakers drown and hear their cry: “If God himself had not been on our side, If God himself had not been on our side, When the Atlantic rose against us, why, Then it had swallowed us up quick.”
IV
This is the end of the whaleroad and the whale
Who spewed Nantucket bones on the thrashed swell And stirred the troubled waters to whirlpools To send the Pequod packing off to hell: This is the end of them, three-quarters fools, Snatching at straws to sail
Seaward and seaward on the turntail whale, Spouting out blood and water as it rolls, Sick as a dog to these Atlantic shoals:
Clamavimus, O depths. Let the sea-gulls wail
For water, for the deep where the high tide Mutters to its hurt self, mutters and ebbs. Waves wallow in their wash, go out and out, Leave only the death-rattle of the crabs, The beach increasing, its enormous snout Sucking the ocean’s side.
This is the end of running on the waves;
We are poured out like water. Who will dance
The mast-lashed master of Leviathans
Up from this field of Quakers in their unstoned graves?
V
When the whale’s viscera go and the roll Of its corruption overruns this world
Beyond tree-swept Nantucket and Woods Hole And Martha’s Vineyard, Sailor, will your sword Whistle and fall and sink into the fat?
In the great ash-pit of Jehoshaphat
The bones cry for the blood of the white whale, The fat flukes arch and whack about its ears, The death-lance churns into the sanctuary, tears The gun-blue swingle, heaving like a flail,
And hacks the coiling life out: it works and drags And rips the sperm-whale’s midriff into rags, Gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather, Sailor, and gulls go round the stoven timbers Where the morning stars sing out together
And thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers The red flag hammered in the mast-head. Hide Our steel, Jonas Messias, in Thy side.
VI
OUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM
There once the penitents took off their shoes And then walked barefoot the remaining mile; And the small trees, a stream and hedgerows file Slowly along the munching English lane, Like cows to the old shrine, until you lose Track of your dragging pain.
The stream flows down under the druid tree, Shiloah’s whirlpools gurgle and make glad The castle of God. Sailor, you were glad And whistled Sion by that stream. But see:
Our Lady, too small for her canopy,
Sits near the altar. There’s no comeliness At all or charm in that expressionless
Face with its heavy eyelids. As before,
This face, for centuries a memory,
Non est species, neque decor,
Expressionless, expresses God: it goes
Past castled Sion. She knows what God knows, Not Calvary’s Cross nor crib at Bethlehem Now, and the world shall come to Walsingham.
VII
The empty winds are creaking and the oak Splatters and splatters on the cenotaph, The boughs are trembling and a gaff Bobs on the untimely stroke
Of the greased wash exploding on a shoal-bell In the old mouth of the Atlantic. It’s well; Atlantic, you are fouled with the blue sailors, Sea-monsters, upward angel, downward fish: Unmarried and corroding, spare of flesh Mart once of supercilious, wing’d clippers, Atlantic, where your bell-trap guts its spoil You could cut the brackish winds with a knife Here in Nantucket, and cast up the time
When the Lord God formed man from the sea’s slime And breathed into his face the breath of life, And blue-lung’d combers lumbered to the kill. The Lord survives the rainbow of His will.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48984/the-quaker-graveyard-in-nantucket
Sonnet 103 by William Shakespeare,William Shakespeare,"'Sonnet 103' by William Shakespeare describes how useless and feeble words are to describe his love for the Fair Youth. The speaker spends the lines of this poem describing how his poetry doesn't do justice to the young man's beauty. He feels depressed and exhausted by the fact that no matter what he comes up with, he'd immediately be outdone by the Youth's reflection in his glass, or mirror. The speaker has pretty much come to terms with this fact, but he continues to return to it in various ways throughout this series.","Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,
That, having such a scope to show her pride,
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside.
O, blame me not if I no more can write!
Look in your glass, and there appears a face
That overgoes my blunt invention quite,
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
Were it not sinful, then, striving to mend,
To mar the subject that before was well?
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
 And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
 Your own glass shows you when you look in it.",folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/read/103/
You Know All This by Kenneth Koch,Kenneth Koch,"'You Know All This' by Kenneth Koch begins by exploring 'the first…year', with the poet arriving somewhere new. The first three stanzas follow this format, each year Koch's appreciation for the city he has arrived into changing, focusing on features of a different season and emotions in each stanza. It seems that it is within the third year of being in this new city that Koch finds a partner. Yet, while incredibly passionate, depicted through the metaphor of a lit match, their relationship eventually burns out. His partner ignites him, while he seems to slow them down with him 'somnambular' way of life. Although they were together for a 'year', it seems that they were not right for each other, eventually separating. Yet, the emotions and memories they shared live on, the final line revealing the innate connection between the past lovers.","The first, violent year
. . I could not swim or float;
A dark and balanced fear
. . Hung on me like a coat.
The second year it rained,
. . The rain was strict and odd;
The fur of fear remained
. . But I whistled Scheherazade. The summer of the third
. . I stripped with some dispatch:
Still finding me absurd
. . You struck me like a match:
Flaming, naked, stung,
. . I held you for a year,
Persistent as a tongue,
. . Infecting you, my dear.
My hands, somnambular,
. . Have kept you like a vow:
No matter where you are
. . We touch each other now.",https://fourteenlines.blog/tag/you-know-all-this-by-kenneth-koch/
Politics by William Butler Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"'Politics' by William Butler Yeats is a thoughtful poem about war and inner/outer life. It was written the year before he passed away. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, who is commonly considered to be Yeats himself, begins by describing a young girl. He's unwilling to turn himself towards the world's politics, engage with them, and ignore this symbolic woman. He discusses a man, a politician, and what it would be like to be young again. The poem concludes with a statement of longing that suggests that inner experiences outweigh his interest in the broader world.","How can I, that girl standing there,

My attention fix
On Roman or on Russian
Or on Spanish politics,
Yet here's a travelled man that knows
What he talks about,
And there's a politician
That has both read and thought,
And maybe what they say is true
Of war and war's alarms,
But O that I were young again
And held her in my arms",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57588/politics-56d23b40c4ed6
"The Gardener XLI: Peace, My Heart by Rabindranath Tagore",Rabindranath Tagore,"'The Gardener LXI: Peace, My Heart' by Rabindranath Tagore is a poem filled with beautiful images depicting death as something one should accept. In the first lines of 'The Gardener LXI: Peace, My Heart,' the speaker begins by addressing his heart and the nature of death. It's inevitable, and therefore not worth worrying about. Rather than fighting it, the speaker alludes, one should enter into it like a bird or a flower, with the “folding of the wings.” He speaks to “you” in the second half of the poem, encouraging “you” to take into consideration everything he's said and offering to light this listener's way into the next life.","Peace, my heart, let the time for
the parting be sweet.
Let it not be a death but completeness.
Let love melt into memory and pain
into songs.
Let the flight through the sky end
in the folding of the wings over the
nest.
Let the last touch of your hands be
gentle like the flower of the night.
Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a
moment, and say your last words in
silence.
I bow to you and hold up my lamp
to light you on your way.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-gardener-lxi-peace-my-heart/
The Return by Ezra Pound,Ezra Pound,"The Return' by Ezra Pound describes the return of the Gods who have weakened to an almost unrecognizable form through the ages. The poem begins with the speaker stating that “they” are returning. The gods are tentative in their steps as if they are unsure how to proceed. They sway and have trouble walking. It is immediately clear they do not have some strength they used to. This is only emphasized in the next lines as the speaker remembers what they, and their “silver hounds” used to be like. They had a strength that was unmatched and a ferocity to be feared. 'The Return' concludes with the gods remaining in their “pallid” and sick form. In the speaker's eyes, they will never have the power they used to.","See, they return; ah, see the tentative
Movements, and the slow feet, The trouble in the pace and the uncertain Wavering! See, they return, one, and by one, With fear, as half-awakened; As if the snow should hesitate And murmur in the wind, and half turn back; These were the ""Wing'd-with-Awe,"" inviolable. Gods of the wingèd shoe! With them the silver hounds, sniffing the trace of air! Haie! Haie! These were the swift to harry; These the keen-scented; These were the souls of blood. Slow on the leash, pallid the leash-men!",https://poets.org/poem/return-1
Ariel by Sylvia Plath,Sylvia Plath,"“Ariel”' by Sylvia Plath describes the terror of a wild horseback ride and the mental and emotional transformation that the rider, and speaker, goes through as she faces death. The poem begins with a calm “stasis” in which nothing is happening until the horse, “Ariel,” throws herself headlong into a charge. The speaker is holding on for dear life, unable to grasp her neck. The hills and landmarks of the countryside are pouring past them. As she rides, she begins to lose pieces of herself, she is shedding her past life and “stringencies” and becoming something new. She is merging with Ariel and becoming the “arrow” that will take her to a new life. The poem ends with the two charging on into the burning sun/future that awaits them.","Stasis in darkness.
Then the substanceless blue Pour of tor and distances.
God’s lioness, How one we grow,
Pivot of heels and knees!—The furrow
Splits and passes, sister to The brown arc
Of the neck I cannot catch,
Nigger-eye Berries cast dark Hooks—
Black sweet blood mouthfuls, Shadows.
Something else
Hauls me through air—
Thighs, hair;
Flakes from my heels.
White
Godiva, I unpeel—
Dead hands, dead stringencies.
And now I
Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas. The child’s cry
Melts in the wall. And I
Am the arrow,
The dew that flies
Suicidal, at one with the drive Into the red
Eye, the cauldron of morning.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/49001/ariel
Spring by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"'Spring' by Edna St. Vincent Millay is a short, surprising poem that presents a negative view of spring. The poem begins with the speaker asking “April,” the month usually associated with the spring season, why it has to come back. Beauty, she notes, is not enough of a reason. There is a fictional aspect in this beauty that bothers the speaker. She knows that it's not the truth. There is far more death and decay under the surface. The speaker describes spring as an “idiot” in the last few lines of the poem.","To what purpose, April, do you return again?
Beauty is not enough.
You can no longer quiet me with the redness
Of little leaves opening stickily.
I know what I know.
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
The spikes of the crocus.
The smell of the earth is good.
It is apparent that there is no death.
But what does that signify?
Not only under ground are the brains of men
Eaten by maggots.
Life in itself
Is nothing,
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,
April
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44728/spring-56d223f01f86e
Good-bye by Walter de la Mare,Walter de la Mare,"This hauntingly and lyrically touching piece of Walter de la Mare is about the “last of last words,” “Goodbye,” and how it affects a listener. De la Mare paints the impression of the parting words a person will ever speak, “Goodbye.” His persona compares the void these words create by comparing it to the “last dismantled flower” in a weed-grown fence or noise so faint that it is barely audible. The speaker then describes the emptiness that remains after these words are spoken, like darkness hovering over the haunted eyes or candles burning out into nothingness. The feeling of obscurity is evident throughout the poem. In the end, de la Mare describes how the person's absence wreaks havoc in his mind by the line, “Toss on in vain the whispering trees of Eden.” Overall, he creates an intricate image of the emotional toll the last words of a person take and the silence and emptiness that follows after their abrupt departure.","The last of last words spoken is, Good-bye -
The last dismantled flower in the weed-grown hedge,
The last thin rumour of a feeble bell far ringing,
The last blind rat to spurn the mildewed rye.

A hardening darkness glasses the haunted eye,
Shines into nothing the watcher's burnt-out candle,
Wreathes into scentless nothing the wasting incense,
Faints in the outer silence the hunting-cry.

Love of its muted music breathes no sigh,
Thought in her ivory tower gropes in her spinning,
Toss on in vain the whispering trees of Eden,
Last of all last words spoken is, Good-bye.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8494511-Good-bye-by-Walter-de-la-Mare
Ashes of Life by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"'Ashes of Life' by Edna St. Vincent Millay is told from the perspective of a speaker who has lost all touch with her own ambitions and is stuck within the monotonous rut of everyday life. The poem begins with the speaker stating that “Love” has left her and in it's wake is the inescapable sameness of the days. She no longer knows how to live her life and must force herself to eat and start her day. As soon as she is awake she is ready for night to fall, but when she finally gets in bed, she is unable to sleep. This pattern is repeating itself over and over. In the second stanza the speaker states how she no longer knows what she is supposed to do everyday, and that anything she does attempt to do, she gets bored of quickly. She feels as if there is no point to finishing anything she starts. Finally, the narrator describes how her neighbors are spying on her and hoping to find out what happened in her life. She feels a deep depression about the state of the world she is living in. She does not want to have to deal with “to-morrow and to-morrow.”","Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike;
Eat I must, and sleep I will, — and would that night were here!
But ah! — to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike!
Would that it were day again! — with twilight near!

Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;
This or that or what you will is all the same to me;
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through, —
There's little use in anything as far as I can see.

Love has gone and left me, — and the neighbors knock and borrow,
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse, —
And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
There's this little street and this little house.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44717/ashes-of-life
Meeting at Night by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,"'Meeting at Night' by Robert Browning describes a journey undertaken by the speaker to meet with the person he loves at night outside their farmhouse. The poem begins with the speaker on a boat, sailing through the dark waters of the sea. It is unclear at first if there is a point to his travels or if he is just moving aimlessly through the landscape. He takes note of the moon, which is only half-full. This provides him with just enough light to see the land in the distance. It is not enough for him to make out any distinct features. This does not bother the speaker—making it likely he has taken this trip before. Thereafter, he makes it to land and is welcomed by the “slushy sand” in which he leaves his boat. He makes his way across fields until a farmhouse is visible in the distance. Upon reaching its window he taps on the glass and is rewarded with the spark of a match and the voice of his lover. The two can meet in secret in the final line.","I
The grey sea and the long black land;
And the yellow half-moon large and low;
And the startled little waves that leap
In fiery ringlets from their sleep,
As I gain the cove with pushing prow,
And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.
II
Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;
Three fields to cross till a farm appears;
A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch
And blue spurt of a lighted match,
And a voice less loud, thro' its joys and fears,
Than the two hearts beating each to each!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43766/meeting-at-night
Suicide’s Note by Langston Hughes,Langston Hughes,"'Suicide's Note' by Langston Hughes is a short emotional poem that speaks very simply and peacefully on life, suicide, and death. The poem begins with the speaker using two short words to describe the atmosphere, “The calm.” This phrase speaks to the atmosphere the speaker experienced and that in the poem itself. The speaker describes how he stood before a river and looked down into its waters. 'Suicide's Note' concludes with the river's “Cool face,” asking the speaker “for a kiss.” It is unclear whether or not he accepted, but considering the title, he most likely did.","The calm, Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/147906/suicide39s-note
To a Star by Lucretia Maria Davidson,Lucretia Maria Davidson,"‘To a Star‘ by Lucretia Maria Davidson is a simple, impassioned poem that speaks about the nature of Heaven and the stars in the sky. 

The speaker of ‘To a Star’ spends the poem gazing into the night sky considering the place of the star on the brow of heaven. She imagines what it’s like to be in heaven, how time passes as well as how the angels play music and create shelter. The star resides in a place that she would very much, if her soul were free, like to be. She determines at the end of the poem that she’s going to head straight there when she can.","Thou brightly-glittering star of even,
Thou gem upon the brow of Heaven
Oh! were this fluttering spirit free,
How quick 't would spread its wings to thee.

How calmly, brightly dost thou shine,
Like the pure lamp in Virtue's shrine!
Sure the fair world which thou may'st boast
Was never ransomed, never lost.

There, beings pure as Heaven's own air,
Their hopes, their joys together share;
While hovering angels touch the string,
And seraphs spread the sheltering wing.

There cloudless days and brilliant nights,
Illumed by Heaven's refulgent lights;
There seasons, years, unnoticed roll,
And unregretted by the soul.

Thou little sparkling star of even,
Thou gem upon an azure Heaven,
How swiftly will I soar to thee,
When this imprisoned soul is free!",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8580183-To-a-Star-by-Lucretia-Maria-Davidson
Porphyria’s Lover by Robert Browning,Robert Browning,"Robert Browning’s poem, ‘Porphyria’s Lover,’ opens up with a classic setting. It’s a stormy evening. The rain and the wind are harsh. The speaker is alone in a small cottage. Suddenly, a woman enters, bringing cheer and warmth in the midst of the dark and cold night. It seems like a classic love poem, but when the tone shifts and the speaker does the unthinkable, it leaves the reader questioning everything from the authority of the speaker to the reality of his descriptions. The woman’s voice is not heard, and the reader is forced to draw conclusions from the voice of a speaker who proves to be less than trustworthy.","The rain set early in to-night,
The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
And did its worst to vex the lake:
I listened with heart fit to break.
When glided in Porphyria; straight
She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
Which done, she rose, and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
And, last, she sat down by my side
And called me. When no voice replied,
She put my arm about her waist,
And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved me — she
Too weak, for all her heart's endeavour,
To set its struggling passion free
From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
And give herself to me for ever.
But passion sometimes would prevail,
Nor could to-night's gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
For love of her, and all in vain:
So, she was come through wind and rain.
Be sure I looked up at her eyes
Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
Made my heart swell, and still it grew
While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her. No pain felt she;
I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
I warily oped her lids: again
Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
And I untightened next the tress
About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
I propped her head up as before,
Only, this time my shoulder bore
Her head, which droops upon it still:
The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
That all it scorned at once is fled,
And I, its love, am gained instead!
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how
Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
And all night long we have not stirred,
And yet God has not said a word!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46313/porphyrias-lover
Elizabeth’s War with the Christmas Bear by Norman Dubie,Norman Dubie,"'Elizabeth's War with the Christmas Bear' by Norman Dubie is an interesting and memorable poem about how Queen Elizabeth I survived an attack by a bear. The poem opens with a description of the horrible conditions the bear and dogs endured. Both were tormented and baited, ensuring they were violent. At one point, one of the bears, later named Peter (a gift from the Russian royal family), turns on the Queen and starts to make moves towards her box. The bear is shot down, and the Queen honors it with a burial. She later digs it up, has its bones bleached, and keeps it by her bed with candles in its eyes. It reminds her of herself in the end.","The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked
Eggs; the weakest are
Slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented
With the blood of deer brought to the pastures by Elizabeth’s
Men—the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate.

The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country.
The bear is baited: the nostrils
Are blown full with pepper, the Irish wolf dogs
Are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley:

And the bear’s hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear
Is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is
Almost instantly worried by the dogs. At the very moment that
Elizabeth took Essex’s head, a giant brown bear
Stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . .
He took away the sun, took
A wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into
The white lap of Elizabeth I—arrows and staves rained

On his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing
Into the Queen’s private boxes—he grinned
Into her battered eggshell face.
Another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth
He showered
Blood all over Elizabeth and her Privy Council.

The very next evening, a cool evening, the Queen demanded
Thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept

All that Sunday night and much of the next morning.
Some said she was guilty of this and that.
The Protestant Queen gave the defeated bear
A grave in a Catholic cemetery. The marker said:
Peter, a Solstice Bear, a gift of the Tsarevitch to Elizabeth.

After a long winter she had the grave opened. The bear’s skeleton
Was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside,
Put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then
She spoke to it:

You were a Christmas bear—behind your eyes
I see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling
Of your mother’s blood which has dried in your hair; you have
Troubled a Queen who was afraid
When seated in shade which, standing,
You had created! A Queen who often wakes with a dream
Of you at night—
Now, you’ll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you
Will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day
You will be in this cold room—your constant grin,
You’ll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are,

Every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51383/elizabeths-war-with-the-christmas-bear
The Steelworks by Owen Sheers,Owen Sheers,"‘The Steelworks’ explores the deindustrialization of Wales, losing its prime industry and forcing its workers into unemployment. The men, once priding themselves on their typically masculine job, are emasculated by the work moving abroad, now spending their days mindlessly lifting in the gym.","except it doesn't anymore.
A deserted mothership
becalmed on the valley's floor,
sheep passing through the car park,
padlocks rusting on the gates
and birds nesting in the breathless vents.
The work happens elsewhere now,
sometimes all day - men pressing and dipping
in the lifting bays, locking out elbows,
rolling a bicep up an arm then away,
or just kneeling and bowing
to the benediction of a lateral pull.
Pumping iron under strip lights,
they take the strain of another afternoon shift
with screwed tight eyes, pneumatic sighs,
while at the window - still the rain,
rolling off the clouds in sheets
across a brushed-metal sky.",https://genius.com/Owen-sheers-the-steelworks-annotated
Don’t Quit by Edgar Albert Guest,Edgar Guest,"'Don't Quit' by Edgar Albert Guest is an inspirational poem that should inspire readers to work hard no matter how impossible a situation seems. In the first stanzas of this poem, the speaker admits that things are going to seem “low” at points in one's life. One might want to be happy but also have to deal with negative circumstances out of their control. On these occasions, he says, “rest if you must, but don't you quit.” As the lines progress, the speaker includes several vague descriptions of people who have struggled, quit without knowing how close they were to success. The poem ends on the same note in which it began, inspiring readers to stick through the fight even when “you're hardest hit.”","When Things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
When the funds are low and debts are high,
And you want to Smile but have to sigh.
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest, if you must, but don't you quit.

Life is queer with its twists and turns,
As everyone of us sometimes learns,
And many a failure turns about,
When he might have won if he'd stuck it out,
Don't give up though the pace seems slow,
You might succeed with another blow.

Often the struggler has given up,
When he might captured the victor's cup.
And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,
How close he was to the golden crown,

Success is failure turned inside out,
The silver tint of clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell how close you are,
It may be near when it seems afar,

The Fawn by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"'The Fawn' by Edna St. Vincent Millay tells of an encounter between a deer and a speaker who wants nothing more than to be accepted by the forest. The poem begins with the speaker vaguely describing an encounter she had with a deer. The importance of the memory is clear from the beginning. It is something she doesn't expect to ever happen again and this gives the tone a distinct sadness. In the next lines, she describes what it was like to come upon the deer. She was surprised to see him there, by himself in the moss. His mother was not around and she wondered why this is the case. In the last two stanzas, the speaker conveys her desire to be accepted by the deer and allowed to exist alongside him. She doesn't want to be loved, she just wants to be a part of the ecosystem. The poem concludes with a long question. The deer suddenly becomes alarmed and runs from the speaker. She is bothered by this turn of events because she can't figure out what she did wrong.","There it was I saw what I shall never forget
And never retrieve.
Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to
believe,
He lay, yet there he lay,
Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished cleft
small ebony hoves,
The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer.

Surely his mother had never said, ""Lie here
Till I return,"" so spotty and plain to see
On the green moss lay he.
His eyes had opened; he considered me.

I would have given more than I care to say
To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend
One moment only of that forest day:


Might I have had the acceptance, not the love
Of those clear eyes;
Might I have been for him in the bough above
Or the root beneath his forest bed,
A part of the forest, seen without surprise.

Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he
depart
That jerked him to his jointy knees,
And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling
On his new legs, between the stems of the white
trees?",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-fawn/
Blueberries After Dark by W.S. Merwin,W.S. Merwin,"Blueberries After Dark' by W.S. Merwin is a short, haunting poem in which the poet describes what darkness is and how it relates to his mother's losses. In the first lines of this poem, the poet describes blueberries at night, the taste of the experience, and what he learned from his mother. She told him directly that he's not “afraid of the dark.” Instead, he learned over time, people are afraid of deeper, all-consuming loss such as that which his mother experienced throughout her life. She lost almost all the important people in her life, defining for the poet what there truly is to fear. She knew that the dark wasn't what one should be afraid of.","So this is the way the night tastesKipahulu palms in the moonlight
one at a time
not early or late

my mother told me
that I was not afraid of the dark
and when I looked it was true

how did she know
so long ago

with her father dead
almost before she could remember
and her mother following him
not long after
and then her grandmother
who had brought her up
and a little later
her only brother
and then her firstborn
gone as soon
as he was born
she knew",https://merwinconservancy.org/2014/04/blueberries-after-dark/
Rain by Kazim Ali,Kazim Ali,"‘Rain‘ by Kazim Ali describes a rainstorm and the impact the scene had on one speaker and his perception of the world. In the first lines, the speaker begins by describing the sky as ink-filled. The dark clouds gathered and people began running for cover. Despite this fact, he feels a connection to the rain throughout his whole body. At the end of the text, this connection becomes spiritual. He speaks on his notebook, the impact of the rain on the storefronts, and its ability to cleanse one’s mind and body.","With thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.
Pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.
Over the echo of the water, I hear a voice saying my name.
No one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.
The pages of my notebook soak, then curl. I’ve written:
“Yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.”
The sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face.
The window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.
I am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled.
If I open my mouth now, I could drown in the rain.
I hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me.
The night collapses into your skin. I am the rain.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54262/rain-56d23467ac47f

The Lesson by Roger McGough,Roger McGough,"'The Lesson' by Roger McGough is an amusing poem that depicts a fictional teacher who loses his temper for the last time with his students. In the first lines of the poem, the teacher walks into the classroom to a familiar sight – his students not listening to him and creating a great deal of noise. He tells them that it's time to learn a lesson. Over the following stanzas, he brings out multiple weapons, killing everyone in his classroom. At one point, the “Head” looks into the classroom to see what's going on and nods understandably. The poem ends with the teacher telling his now quiet classroom that this is the “lesson” that they needed to learn.","Chaos ruled OK in the classroom
as bravely the teacher walked in
the nooligans ignored him
his voice was lost in the din

'The theme for today is violence
and homework will be set
I'm going to teach you a lesson
one that you'll never forget'

He picked on a boy who was shouting
and throttled him then and there
then garrotted the girl behind him
(the one with grotty hair)

Then sword in hand he hacked his way
between the chattering rows
'First come, first severed' he declared
'fingers, feet or toes'

He threw the sword at a latecomer
it struck with deadly aim
then pulling out a shotgun
he continued with his game

The first blast cleared the backrow
(where those who skive hang out)
they collapsed like rubber dinghies
when the plug's pulled out

'Please may I leave the room sir? '
a trembling vandal enquired
'Of course you may' said teacher
put the gun to his temple and fired

The Head popped a head round the doorway
to see why a din was being made
nodded understandingly
then tossed in a grenade

And when the ammo was well spent
with blood on every chair
Silence shuffled forward
with its hands up in the air

The teacher surveyed the carnage
the dying and the dead
He waggled a finger severely
'Now let that be a lesson' he said",poemhunter.com/poem/the-lesson/
A Noiseless Patient Spider by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"A Noiseless Patient Spider” explores the relationship between the individual self and the larger world. The poem depicts a spider that is isolated in space but actively sending filaments ""out of itself,"" seeking connection as it builds its web. This spider becomes an extended metaphor for the speaker’s soul, which is likewise isolated and working to find a sense of connection. Ultimately, the poem suggests that in spite of the loneliness people might experience as individuals, the work of the soul is to constantly seek and make connections—however daunting such a task may be.","A noiseless patient spider,
I mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,
Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

And you O my soul where you stand,
Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,
Till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold,
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45473/a-noiseless-patient-spider
Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"'Ozymandias' by P. B. Shelley describes a traveler's reaction to the half-buried, worn-out statue of the great pharaoh, Ramses II. In this poem, the speaker describes meeting a traveler “from an antique land.” The title, 'Ozymandias,' notifies the reader that this land is most probably Egypt since Ozymandias was what the Greeks called Ramses II. He was a great and terrible pharaoh in ancient Egypt. The traveler tells a story to the speaker. In the story, he describes visiting Egypt. There, he saw a large and intimidating statue of Ramses in the desert. He can tell that the sculptor must have known his subject well because it is obvious from the statue's face that this man was a great leader, but one who could also be very vicious. He describes his sneer as having a “cold command.” Even though the leader was probably very great, it seems that the only thing that survives from his realm is this statue, which is half-buried and somewhat falling apart.","I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias
Time by Percy Bysshe Shelley,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"Form and Tone The poem is a fairly short piece. It consists of just two stanzas which both consist of five lines each. The poem then is written in free verse. Each of the lines consists of ten syllables. This level of accuracy was a calling card of Shelley in his work. The rhyming scheme alters in the first and second stanzas. In the first stanza, the pattern is (ABAB-) in the second stanza the pattern is (AA-BB) perhaps this is used as a device to represent the turbulent nature of the seas?","Unfathomable Sea! whose waves are years,
Ocean of Time, whose waters of deep woe
Are brackish with the salt of human tears!
Thou shoreless flood, which in thy ebb and flow
Claspest the limits of mortality!
And sick of prey, yet howling on for more,
Vomitest thy wrecks on its inhospitable shore;
Treacherous in calm, and terrible in storm,
Who shall put forth on thee,
Unfathomable Sea?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45141/time-56d224858f450
The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss,Dr. Seuss,"The Cat in the Hat' by Dr. Seuss is a light-hearted children's book that describes the antics of the cat in the hat. The story takes place in a short period of time, starting out with the cat barging into Sally and her brother's home and showing off his balancing skills. As the fish predicted, the cat falls, making a huge mess of everything he was holding. As if to remedy the problem, he brings in Thing One and Thing Two, who only make the mess worse. Finally, in the end, the cat comes back with his huge cleaning machine and gets everything sorted right before the children's mother gets home. ","the sun did not shine.
it was too wet to play.
so we sat in the house
all that cold, cold, wet day.

i sat there with sally.
we sat there, we two.
and i said, 'how i wish
we had something to do!'

too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball.
so we sat in the house.
we did nothing at all.

so all we could do was to
sit!
sit!
sit!
sit!
and we did not like it.
not one little bit.

and then something went BUMP!
how that bump made us jump!
we looked!
then we saw him step in on the mat!
we looked!
and we saw him!
the cat in the hat!
and he said to us,
'why do you sit there like that?'
'i know it is wet
and the sun is not sunny.
but we can have
lots of good fun that is funny!'

'i know some good games we could play,'
said the cat.
'i know some new tricks,'
said the cat in the hat.
'a lot of good tricks.
i will show them to you.
your mother will not mind at all if i do.'

then sally and i
did not know what to say.
our mother was out of the house
for the day.

but our fish said, 'no! no!
make that cat go away!
tell that cat in the hat
you do NOT want to play.
he should not be here.
he should not be about.
he should not be here
when your mother is out!'

'now! now! have no fear.
have no fear!' said the cat.
'my tricks are not bad,'
said the cat in the hat.
'why, we can have
lots of good fun, if you wish,
with a game that i call
up-up-up with a fish!'

'put me down!' said the fish.
'this is no fun at all!
put me down!' said the fish.
'i do NOT wish to fall!'

'have no fear!' said the cat.
'i will not let you fall.
i will hold you up high
as i stand on a ball.
with a book one one hand!
and a cup on my hat!
but that is not ALL i can do!
said the cat...

'look at me!
look at me now!' said the cat.
'with a cup and a cake
on the top of my hat!
i can hold up TWO books!
i can hold up the fish!
and a little toy ship!
and some milk on a dish!
and look!
i can hop up and down on the ball!
but that is not all!
oh, no.
that is not all...

'look at me!
look at me!
look at me NOW!
it is fun to have fun
but you have to know how.
i can hold up the cup
and the milk and the cake!
i can hold up these books!
and the fish on a rake!
i can hold the toy ship
and a little toy man!
and look! with my tail
i can hold a red fan!
i can fan with the fan
as i hop on the ball!
but that is not all.
oh, no.
that is not all...'

that is what the cat said...
then he fell on his head!
he came down with a bump
from up there on the ball.
and sally and i,
we saw ALL the things fall!

and our fish came down, too.
he fell into a pot!
he said, 'do i like this?
oh, no! i do not.
this is not a good game,'
said our fish as he lit.
'no, i do not like it,
not one little bit!'

'now look what you did!'
said the fish to the cat.
'now look at this house!
look at this! look at that!
you sank our toy ship,
sank it deep in the cake.
you shook up our house
and you bent our new rake.
you SHOULD NOT be here
when our mother is not.
you get out of this house!'
said the fish in the pot.

'but i like to be here.
oh, i like it a lot!'
said the cat in the hat
to the fish in the pot.
'i will NOT go away.
i do NOT wish to go!
and so,' said the cat in the hat,
'so
so
so...
i will show you
another good game that i know!'

and then he ran out.
and, then, fast as a fox,
the cat in the hat
came back in with a box.
a big red wood box.
it was shut with a hook.
'now look at this trick,'
said the cat.
'take a look!'

then he got up on top
with a tip of his hat.
'i call this game fun-in-a-box,'
said the cat.
'in this box are two things
i will show to you now.
you will like these two things,'
said the cat with a bow.

'i will pick up the hook.
you will see something new.
two things. and i call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
these Things will not bite you.
they want to have fun.'
then, out of the box
came Thing Two and Thing One!
and they ran to us fast.
they said, 'how do you do?
would you like to shake hands
with Thing One and Thing Two?'

and sally and i
did not know what to do.
so we had to shake hands
with Thing One and Thing Two.
we shook their two hands.
but our fish said, 'no! no!
those Things should not be
in this house! make them go!
they should not be here
when your mother is not!
put them out! put them out!'
said the fish in the pot.

'have no fear, little fish,'
said the cat in the hat.
'these Things are good Things.'
and he gave them a pat.
'they are tame. oh, so tame!
they have come here to play.
they will give you some fun
on this wet, wet, wet day.'

now, here is a game that they like,'
said the cat.
'they like to fly kites,'
said the cat in the hat.

'no! not in the house!'
said the fish in the pot.
'they should not fly kites
in a house! they should not.
oh, the things they will bump!
oh, the things they will hit!
oh, i do not like it!
not one little bit!'

then sally and i
saw them run down the hall.
we saw those two Things
bump their kites on the wall!
bump! thump! thump! bump!
down the wall in the hall.

thing two and thing one!
they ran up! they ran down!
on the string of one kite
we saw mother's new gown!
her gown with the dots
that are pink, white and red.
then we saw one kite bump
on the head of her bed!

then those things ran about
with big bumps, jumps and kicks
and with hops and big thumps
and all kinds of bad tricks.
and i said,
'i do NOT like the way that they play!
if mother could see this,
oh, what would she say!'

then our fish said, 'look! look!'
and our fish shook with fear.
'your mother is on her way home!
do you hear?
oh, what will she do to us?
what will she say?
oh, she will not like it
to find us this way!'

'so DO something! fast!' said the fish.
'do you hear!
i saw her. your mother!
your mother is near!
so, as fast as you can,
think of something to do!
you will have to get rid of
thing one and thing two!'

so, as fast as i could,
i went after my net.
and i said, 'with my net
i can get them i bet.
i bet, with my net,
i can get those things yet!'

then i let down my net.
it came down with a PLOP!
and i had them! at last!
those two things had to stop.
then i said to the cat,
'now you do as i say.
you pack up those Things
and you take them away!'

'oh dear!' said the cat.
'you did not like our game...
oh dear.
what a shame!
what a shame!
what a shame!'

then he shut up the things
in the box with the hook.
and the cat went away
with a sad kind of look.

'that is good,' said the fish.
'he has gone away. yes.
but your mother will come.
she will find this big mess!
and this mess is so big
and so deep and so tall,
we can not pick it up.
there is no way at all!'

and THEN!
who was back in the house?
why, the cat!
'have no fear of this mess,'
said the cat in the hat.
'i always pick up all my playthings
and so...
i will show you another
good trick that i know!'

then we saw him pick up all the things that were down.
he picked up the cake,
and the rake, and the gown,
and the milk, and the strings,
and the books, and the dish,
and the fan, and the cup,
and the ship, and the fish.
and he put them away.
then he said, 'that is that.'
and then he was gone
with a tip of his hat.

then our mother came in
and she said to us two,
'did you have any fun?
tell me. what did you do?'

and sally and i did not know
what to say.
should we tell her
the things that went on there that day?

should we tell her about it?
now, what SHOULD we do?
well...
what would YOU do

Cinderella by Roald Dahl,Roald Dahl,"Cinderella' by Roald Dahl retells the story of Cinderella and how rather than marrying the Prince, she ends up with a lovely man who makes jam. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the story which is about to follow is not the one the reader might expect. It is the true story of Cinderella, unedited. In the following stanzas, Cinderella makes her way to the ball via help from a Fairy. She meets the Prince and loses her dress and her shoe. Rather than try to fit their feet into the shoe, the ugly sisters flush it down the toilet and replace it with one of their own. When the Prince sees that the shoe fits the first ugly sister he beheads her and then proceeds to do the same to the other sister. Cinderella is turned off by the idea of a man who beheads people and wishes to be married to a “lovely feller.” Immediately her wish is granted and she lives happily ever after.","I guess you think you know this story.
You don't. The real one's much more gory.
The phoney one, the one you know,
Was cooked up years and years ago,
And made to sound all soft and sappy
just to keep the children happy.
Mind you, they got the first bit right,
The bit where, in the dead of night,
The Ugly Sisters, jewels and all,
Departed for the Palace Ball,
While darling little Cinderella
Was locked up in a slimy cellar,
Where rats who wanted things to eat,
Began to nibble at her feet.

She bellowed 'Help!' and 'Let me out!
The Magic Fairy heard her shout.
Appearing in a blaze of light,
She said: 'My dear, are you all right?'
'All right?' cried Cindy .'Can't you see
'I feel as rotten as can be!'
She beat her fist against the wall,
And shouted, 'Get me to the Ball!
'There is a Disco at the Palace!
'The rest have gone and I am jealous!
'I want a dress! I want a coach!
'And earrings and a diamond brooch!
'And silver slippers, two of those!
'And lovely nylon panty hose!
'Done up like that I'll guarantee
'The handsome Prince will fall for me!'
The Fairy said, 'Hang on a tick.'
She gave her wand a mighty flick
And quickly, in no time at all,
Cindy was at the Palace Ball!

It made the Ugly Sisters wince
To see her dancing with the Prince.
She held him very tight and pressed
herself against his manly chest.
The Prince himself was turned to pulp,
All he could do was gasp and gulp.
Then midnight struck. She shouted,'Heck!
I've got to run to save my neck!'
The Prince cried, 'No! Alas! Alack!'
He grabbed her dress to hold her back.
As Cindy shouted, 'Let me go!'
The dress was ripped from head to toe.

She ran out in her underwear,
And lost one slipper on the stair.
The Prince was on it like a dart,
He pressed it to his pounding heart,
'The girl this slipper fits,' he cried,
'Tomorrow morn shall be my bride!
I'll visit every house in town
'Until I've tracked the maiden down!'
Then rather carelessly, I fear,
He placed it on a crate of beer.

At once, one of the Ugly Sisters,
(The one whose face was blotched with blisters)
Sneaked up and grabbed the dainty shoe,
And quickly flushed it down the loo.
Then in its place she calmly put
The slipper from her own left foot.
Ah ha, you see, the plot grows thicker,
And Cindy's luck starts looking sicker.

Next day, the Prince went charging down
To knock on all the doors in town.
In every house, the tension grew.
Who was the owner of the shoe?
The shoe was long and very wide.
(A normal foot got lost inside.)
Also it smelled a wee bit icky.
(The owner's feet were hot and sticky.)
Thousands of eager people came
To try it on, but all in vain.
Now came the Ugly Sisters' go.
One tried it on. The Prince screamed, 'No!'
But she screamed, 'Yes! It fits! Whoopee!
'So now you've got to marry me!'
The Prince went white from ear to ear.
He muttered, 'Let me out of here.'
'Oh no you don't! You made a vow!
'There's no way you can back out now!'
'Off with her head!'The Prince roared back.
They chopped it off with one big whack.
This pleased the Prince. He smiled and said,
'She's prettier without her head.'
Then up came Sister Number Two,
Who yelled, 'Now I will try the shoe!'
'Try this instead!' the Prince yelled back.
He swung his trusty sword and smack
Her head went crashing to the ground.
It bounced a bit and rolled around.
In the kitchen, peeling spuds,
Cinderella heard the thuds
Of bouncing heads upon the floor,
And poked her own head round the door.
'What's all the racket? 'Cindy cried.
'Mind your own bizz,' the Prince replied.
Poor Cindy's heart was torn to shreds.
My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads!
How could I marry anyone
Who does that sort of thing for fun?

The Prince cried, 'Who's this dirty slut?
'Off with her nut! Off with her nut!'
Just then, all in a blaze of light,
The Magic Fairy hove in sight,
Her Magic Wand went swoosh and swish!
'Cindy! 'she cried, 'come make a wish!
'Wish anything and have no doubt
'That I will make it come about!'
Cindy answered, 'Oh kind Fairy,
'This time I shall be more wary.
'No more Princes, no more money.
'I have had my taste of honey.
I'm wishing for a decent man.
'They're hard to find. D'you think you can?'
Within a minute, Cinderella
Was married to a lovely feller,
A simple jam maker by trade,
Who sold good home-made marmalade.
Their house was filled with smiles and laughter
And they were happy ever after.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8503199-Cinderella-by-Roald-Dahl
Hush’d Be the Camps To-Day by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"The poem 'Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day' by Walt Whitman reveals his intentions of writing a poem in memory of Abraham Lincoln. The poet has employed irony in the poem as he talks of the Death of Lincoln. 'Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day' by Walt Whitman reveals his intentions of writing a poem in memory of Abraham Lincoln. The poet begins by requesting the camps to be quiet in honor of their lost commander. He wants the soldiers to retire and drape the weapons, as the war is done. Despite the sorrow that was befallen by the death of Abraham Lincoln, he brings in a positive note when he says that his commander has no worries about victory or defeat. Further, he states that he doesn't have to worry about the dark times of the war. Considering all these he wants 'the poet' (a soldier or an appeal to himself) to sing a song as they slide down the body of Lincoln to bury. He prefers a soldier from the camp to sing a song, for he knows Lincoln better than anyone.","HUSH'D be the camps to-day;
And, soldiers, let us drape our war-worn weapons;
And each, with musing soul retire, to celebrate,
Our dear commander's death.
No more for him life's stormy conflicts;
Nor victory, nor defeat—No more time's dark events,
Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.
But sing, poet, in our name;
Sing of the love we bore him—because you, dweller in
camps, know it truly.
Sing, to the lower'd coffin there;
Sing, with the shovel'd clods that fill the grave—a
verse,
For the heavy hearts of soldiers",https://poemanalysis.com/walt-whitman/hushd-be-the-camps-to-day/
Eyes and Tears by Andrew Marvell,Andrew Marvell,"The poem, ‘Eyes and Tears‘ by Andrew Marvell is also metaphysical by virtue of its unusual imagery and its metaphors which are both ingenious and just. There is, for instance; the image of tears which better measure tings and which are therefore like the plumb-lines by means of which the depth of water is measured. Then there is the metaphysical image of two tears which have long been weighed by Sorrow within the scales of the eyes, and then been “paid out in equal poise”. Highly metaphysical is the conceit according to which the all-seeing sun each day extracts the essence of this world in the form of moisture which then returns to the earth in the shape of rain-drops which are here regarded as the tears of the sun. However, the Biblical image of Magdalen bathing the feet of Jesus Christ with her tears is not metaphysical but it is valuable in deepening the pathos of Eyes and Tears. There is a metaphysical conceit in the comparison of the copious human tears with broad rivers of overflowing their banks. There is a fanciful picture in the lines where the poet tells us that even the destructive lighting which belongs to Jove gets extinguished in his tears of pity. Then there are a number of images that are partly fanciful but mainly realistic. You can check this kind of image in the lines describing the beauty of eyes swollen with weeping. The beauty of such eyes, the readers are told, is greater than that of the sails of a ship on the homeward run, than that of a pregnant housewife, later than that of the full moon. Perfectly realistic but presented in a highly imaginative manner is the image of the lust of a man dissolving in his tears.","HOW wisely Nature did decree,
With the same eyes to weep and see ;
That, having viewed the object vain,
They might be ready to complain !
And, since the self-deluding sight
In a false angle takes each height,
These tears, which better measure all,
Like watery lines and plummets fall.
Two tears, which sorrow long did weigh
Within the scales of either eye,
And then paid out in equal poise,
Are the true price of all my joys.
What in the world most fair appears,
Yea, even laughter, turns to tears ;
And all the jewels which we prize
Melt in these pendants of the eyes.
I have through every garden been,
Amongst the red, the white, the green,
And yet from all the flowers I saw,
No honey, but these tears could draw.
So the all-seeing sun each day
Distils the world with chymic ray ;
But finds the essence only showers,
Which straight in pity back he pours.
Yet happy they whom grief doth bless,
That weep the more, and see the less ;
And, to preserve their sight more true,
Bathe still their eyes in their own dew.
So Magdalen in tears more wise
Dissolved those captivating eyes,
Whose liquid chains could flowing meet
To fetter her Redeemer's feet.
Not full sails hasting loaden home,
Nor the chaste lady's pregnant womb,
Nor Cynthia teeming shows so fair
As two eyes swollen with weeping are.
The sparkling glance that shoots desire,
Drenched in these waves, does lose its fire ;
Yea oft the Thunderer pity takes,
And here the hissing lightning slakes.
The incense was to Heaven dear,
Not as a perfume, but a tear ;
And stars shew lovely in the night,
But as they seem the tears of light.
Ope then, mine eyes, your double sluice,
And practise so your noblest use ;
For others too can see, or sleep,
But only human eyes can weep.
Now, like two clouds dissolving, drop,
And at each tear in distance stop ;
Now, like two fountains, trickle down ;
Now, like two floods, o'erturn and drown :
Thus let your streams o'erflow your springs,
Till eyes and tears be the same things ;
And each the other's difference bears,
These weeping eyes, those seeing tears.",https://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/marvell/eyesandtears.htm
Break of Day by John Donne,John Donne,"'Break of Day' by John Donne conveys a woman's understanding of her busy lover's dedication, or lack thereof, to their relationship. The poem begins with the speaker asking several questions regarding her partner's interpretation of sunrise. She doesn't feel that just because the sun has come up that he should leave their bed. She sees the sun as lacking the ability to control what they do. But, the man rises and starts his day, reengaging with the work that keeps his focus all the time. As the poem concludes, she compares herself to a mistress. She's always going to come after his business.","‘Tis true, ‘tis day, what though it be?
O wilt thou therefore rise from me?
Why should we rise because ‘tis light?
Did we lie down because ‘twas night?
Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither,
Should in despite of light keep us together.
Light hath no tongue, but is all eye;
If it could speak as well as spy,
This were the worst that it could say,
That being well I fain would stay,
And that I loved my heart and honour so,
That I would not from him, that had them, go.
Must business thee from hence remove?
Oh, that’s the worst disease of love,
The poor, the foul, the false, love can
Admit, but not the busied man.
He which hath business, and makes love, doth do
Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51783/break-of-day
The Wife’s Lament by Anonymous,Anonymous,"'The Wife's Lament' by Anonymous is a multi-layered poem in which a speaker expresses her deep sorrow over her husband's departure. Depending on how one interprets the poem, that departure might refer to his death, his betrayal of her, or his travels to another country. There is evidence for all of these possible solutions to her vaguely defined grief. As the poem progresses, the speaker explains how deeply depressed she is by her circumstances. She's alone, without friends or family, and eventually forced to live in a hole or cave in the ground. “They,” likely the husband's kinsmen, are trying to keep her from finding her husband, whatever that means depending on the interpretation. Now, she has to spend the rest of her days with nothing but unhappiness on her mind. In the last lines, it appears that she's wishing the same sorrow on her husband.","I sing this song, full of sadness,
this song which is myself. I will tell, what I am able,
about what hardships I have faced—since I grew up,
recently or long ago, never more than now.
Always I suffer my misery of exile.
First my lord departed from my people,
over waves rolling; I had grief before dawn
thinking of the lands which held him, my people’s lord.
Then I set out, a friendless stranger, searching
for his retinue, because of my grievous need.
Relatives of this man began to plan
through secret thought that they would separate us,
that we as far apart as possible in the kingdom of the world
would live, wretchedly, and me longing.
My lord commanded me to take a grove for a house:
little of what is beloved to me did I possess in this country,
no loyal friends; for that is my mind’s sadness.
When I found the man who was my complete match,
he was unfortunate, sad of mind and heart,
with thoughts concealed, planning his crime
behind a joyful demeanor. Very often we vowed
that we would never be separated, not by death
or anything else; what was before is now changed,
is now as if it never were, that friendship
between us. Must I who desires you nearby
suffer, my dearly loved, this feud?
Commanded was I to dwell in a forest grove.
Under an oak tree, in a cave—the earth’s chest.
Old is this earth hall and I am filled with longing.
Here is a gloomy valley, treacherous hills,
bitter hedges, briars waxing, overgrown
in this house without joy. Very often my cruel departure
takes hold of me. Friends live on earth
lying in bed with their beloveds
while I in the time before dawn alone walk
under oak tree. In the earth’s chest
I sit many long summer days
weeping for the misery of exile
my many hardships; there I am never able
to rest from my mind’s grief
nor from all the longing that in this life takes hold of me.
It may be that he is always sorrowful,
his heart’s thoughts stern; perhaps he has
a joyful demeanor next to his grief,
its constant sorrowful tumult. Whether he is dependent on himself
for all of his worldly joy, or whether he is an outcast, very far
from his distant country, sitting
under stone cliffs frost-rimmed from storms,
friendless, water flowing before
his echoing home, my lover suffers
much grief of the mind. Too often he remembers
a house full of joy. Woe to those that must
of longing in life abide.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/157730/the-wifes-lament
For Nanabhai Bhatt by Sujata Bhatt,Sujata Bhatt,"'For Nanabhai Bhatt' by Sujata Bhatt describes what kind of a person Nanabhai Bhatt was. This poem is about the personality of the speaker, Sujata Bhatt's grandfather, Nanabhai Bhatt. Old Bhatt appears in her dream as a patient, wise, and optimistic figure. The speaker discusses one incident of Gandhiji meeting her grandfather about a six-year-old girl whom he adopted. Gandhi in order to teach her a lesson about personal looks hurt the girl. When he came to the speaker's grandfather to express his trouble, he stood before him in a silent and composed fashion. Whenever the speaker dreams of her grandfather, she sees him in this old, familiar posture.","In this dream my grandfather
comes to comfort me.
He stands apart
silent
and in his face I see
the patience of his trees
on hot typhoid days
that promise no rain.

His eyes
the color of a crow’s feather in children’s mud,
yet filled with sharp mountain-top light.

I’m sure this was the face the true bald man,
Gandhiji saw when he confessed
about the Harijan girl, the six-year-old
he adopted and tried to educate.
I’m sure these were the eyes the true hermaphrodite,
Gandhiji saw while he explained
how this girl cared too much for clothes,
how one day she went and had her hair bobbed,
the latest fashion, she said.
It was too much.
She had to be set straight,
the sooner the better.
So he had her head shaved
to teach her
not to look in mirrors so often.
At this point Gandhiji turned
towards my grandfather and allowed, so softly:
“But she cried.
I couldn’t stop her crying.
She didn’t touch dinner.
She cried all night.
I brought her to my room,
tucked her in my bed, sang her bhajans,
but she still cried.
I stayed awake beside her.
So this morning I can’t think clearly,
I can’t discuss our plans
for building schools in villages.”
And my grandfather
looked at him with the same face
he shows in my dream.",https://voetica.com/voetica.php?collection=17&poet=900&poem=8507
if everything happens that can’t be done by e.e. cummings,E.E. Cummings,"'if everything happens that can't be done' by E.E. Cummings is a very complex, yet strikingly powerful love poem that plays with the English language. Throughout the stanzas of this piece, Cummings repeats a general pattern of lines with parentheses, repeated structures, and words. It takes quite a while, at least four stanzas, to get into this pattern and start to understand what Cummings, or at least his speaker, was wanting to convey. He emphasizes throughout the stanzas the nature of “one” and how it is a representative of the strength and importance of his relationship with the intended listener of the poem. He uses bird and book-related images to convey his opinion that knowledge is better gained from love and nature than it is from the written word.","if everything happens that can't be done

The Sign-Post by Edward Thomas,Edward Thomas,"The Sign-Post' by Edward Thomas contains a discussion within a speaker's mind about the progression of time and the nature of Heaven. The poem begins with the speaker describing the scene on top of a hill beside a sign-post. It is cold, and the surrounding plant life is mostly dead. Here the speaker wonders which direction he should travel in and is confronted by two opposing voices, presumably within his own head. One mocks him for not knowing and becoming timid with age. The other reminds him that youth is not the only thing in life to be valued. The second voice takes control of the narrative in. It describes how one is going to age whether they want to or not. Eventually one will make their way to heaven where they will look down on the hard days on earth and miss them. They will long for the seasons of winter and spring and the uncertainty of daily life.","The dim sea glints chill. The white sun is shy,
And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry,
Rough, long grasses keep white with frost
At the hilltop by the finger-post;
The smoke of the traveller’s-joy is puffed
Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft.
I read the sign. Which way shall I go?
A voice says: You would not have doubted so
At twenty. Another voice gentle with scorn
Says: At twenty you wished you had never been born.

One hazel lost a leaf of gold
From a tuft at the tip, when the first voice told
The other he wished to know what ’twould be
To be sixty by this same post. “You shall see,”
He laughed—and I had to join his laughter—
“You shall see; but either before or after,
Whatever happens, it must befall,
A mouthful of earth to remedy all
Regrets and wishes shall freely be given;
And if there be a flaw in that heaven
’Twill be freedom to wish, and your wish may be
To be here or anywhere talking to me,
No matter what the weather, on earth,
At any age between death and birth,
To see what day or night can be,
The sun and the frost, the land and the sea,
Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,—
With a poor man of any sort, down to a king,
Standing upright out in the air
Wondering where he shall journey, O where?”",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53743/the-sign-post
Revenge by Letitia Elizabeth Landon,Letitia Elizabeth Landon,"Revenge' by Letitia Elizabeth Landon describes a speaker's happy revenge on her listener who had previously broken her heart. The poem begins with the speaker giving permission for her listener, a man she was in a relationship with, to go with another woman. She tells him he is more than welcome to gaze at her and smell her perfume. The speaker has no desire to reconcile with the man. This is all due to his choice to end the relationship. While the speaker was deeply hurt by this choice she now feels avenged. The woman he has chosen should not be trusted. The speaker knows the woman will soon leave him, causing him the same distress he caused her. When this happens her heart will finally be at peace.","Ay, gaze upon her rose-wreathed hair,
And gaze upon her smile;
Seem as you drank the very air
Her breath perfumed the while:

And wake for her the gifted line,
That wild and witching lay,
And swear your heart is as a shrine,
That only owns her sway.

’Tis well: I am revenged at last,—
Mark you that scornful cheek,—
The eye averted as you pass’d,
Spoke more than words could speak.

Ay, now by all the bitter tears
That I have shed for thee,—
The racking doubts, the burning fears,—
Avenged they well may be—

By the nights pass’d in sleepless care,
The days of endless woe;
All that you taught my heart to bear,
All that yourself will know.

I would not wish to see you laid
Within an early tomb;
I should forget how you betray’d,
And only weep your doom:

But this is fitting punishment,
To live and love in vain,—
Oh my wrung heart, be thou content,
And feed upon his pain.

Go thou and watch her lightest sigh,—
Thine own it will not be;
And bask beneath her sunny eye,—
It will not turn on thee.

’Tis well: the rack, the chain, the wheel,
Far better hadst thou proved;
Ev’n I could almost pity feel,
For thou art not beloved.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44557/revenge-56d223b1d544c
In a Station of the Metro by Ezra Pound,Ezra Pound,"In a Station of the Metro – The Poem The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough. Verbless Poetry As previously mentioned, one of the most striking elements of In the Station of a Metro is that it is written entirely without verbs. The poem is instead formed by combining two sentence fragments, each with a subject, but without an action, for that subject to perform. Needless to say, it can be very difficult to write without using action words, but this style does achieve one thing especially well: it captures a moment in time. In a sentence without action, nothing happens — in imagist poetry especially, this is a strength. In the case of this poem, it reads as an observation, as though the author has taken two photographs and paired them side by side.","The apparition of these faces in the crowd:

Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen by W.B. Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"'Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen' is about the subject of the temporariness of the world, war, violence, and politics depicted in the tone of idealism, frustration, pessimism, and lamentation. The poem, 'Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen' is about the subject of the temporariness of the world, war, violence, and politics depicted in the tone of idealism, frustration, pessimism, and lamentation. It speaks of how the most intelligent and beautiful things have gone from this world while war and violence are still constant in this world. Further, Yeats openly mocks at the great people, the wise, the good, and the mockers as well, who can never prevent negative things from happening in the world. Further, it gives a comprehensive image of violence that prevails in the world.","MANY ingenious lovely things are gone
That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude,
protected from the circle of the moon
That pitches common things about. There stood
Amid the ornamental bronze and stone
An ancient image made of olive wood --
And gone are Phidias' famous ivories
And all the golden grasshoppers and bees.
We too had many pretty toys when young:
A law indifferent to blame or praise,
To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong
Melt down, as it were wax in the sun's rays;
Public opinion ripening for so long
We thought it would outlive all future days.
O what fine thought we had because we thought
That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.
All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,
And a great army but a showy thing;
What matter that no cannon had been turned
Into a ploughshare? Parliament and king
Thought that unless a little powder burned
The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting
And yet it lack all glory; and perchance
The guardsmen's drowsy chargers would not prance.
Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare
Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery
Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,
To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;
The night can sweat with terror as before
We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,
And planned to bring the world under a rule,
Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.
He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned
Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant
From shallow wits; who knows no work can stand,
Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent
On master-work of intellect or hand,
No honour leave its mighty monument,
Has but one comfort left: all triumph would
But break upon his ghostly solitude.
But is there any comfort to be found?
Man is in love and loves what vanishes,
What more is there to say? That country round
None dared admit, if Such a thought were his,
Incendiary or bigot could be found
To burn that stump on the Acropolis,
Or break in bits the famous ivories
Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees.
When Loie Fuller's Chinese dancers enwound
A shining web, a floating ribbon of cloth,
It seemed that a dragon of air
Had fallen among dancers, had whirled them round
Or hurried them off on its own furious path;
So the platonic Year
Whirls out new right and wrong,
Whirls in the old instead;
All men are dancers and their tread
Goes to the barbarous clangour of a gong.
Some moralist or mythological poet
Compares the solitary soul to a swan;
I am satisfied with that,
Satisfied if a troubled mirror show it,
Before that brief gleam of its life be gone,
An image of its state;
The wings half spread for flight,
The breast thrust out in pride
Whether to play, or to ride
Those winds that clamour of approaching night.
A man in his own secret meditation
Is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made
In art or politics;
Some Platonist affirms that in the station
Where we should cast off body and trade
The ancient habit sticks,
And that if our works could
But vanish with our breath
That were a lucky death,
For triumph can but mar our solitude.
The swan has leaped into the desolate heaven:
That image can bring wildness, bring a rage
To end all things, to end
What my laborious life imagined, even
The half-imagined, the half-written page;
O but we dreamed to mend
Whatever mischief seemed
To afflict mankind, but now
That winds of winter blow
Learn that we were crack-pated when we dreamed.
We, who seven years ago
Talked of honour and of truth,
Shriek with pleasure if we show
The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.
Come let us mock at the great
That had such burdens on the mind
And toiled so hard and late
To leave some monument behind,
Nor thought of the levelling wind.
Come let us mock at the wise;
With all those calendars whereon
They fixed old aching eyes,
They never saw how seasons run,
And now but gape at the sun.
Come let us mock at the good
That fancied goodness might be gay,
And sick of solitude
Might proclaim a holiday:
Wind shrieked -- and where are they?
Mock mockers after that
That would not lift a hand maybe
To help good, wise or great
To bar that foul storm out, for we
Traffic in mockery.
Violence upon the roads: violence of horses;
Some few have handsome riders, are garlanded
On delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane,
But wearied running round and round in their courses
All break and vanish, and evil gathers head:
Herodias' daughters have returned again,
A sudden blast of dusty wind and after
Thunder of feet, tumult of images,
Their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind;
And should some crazy hand dare touch a daughter
All turn with amorous cries, or angry cries,
According to the wind, for all are blind.
But now wind drops, dust settles; thereupon
There lurches past, his great eyes without thought
Under the shadow of stupid straw-pale locks,
That insolent fiend Robert Artisson
To whom the love-lorn Lady Kyteler brought
Bronzed peacock feathers, red combs of her cocks.",http://www.csun.edu/~hceng029/yeats/yeatspoems/NineteenNinete
Snow by Louis MacNeice,Louis MacNeice,"'Snow' is about the complexity of the world around us and how it is full of beauty and danger, often at the same time. 'Snow' is about several different experiences that occur at the same time. The speaker watches snow fall outside, admires some roses, eats a tangerine, and is warmed by a fire. It's also about the nature of experience itself, and how difficult it is to convey honestly when there is no one way to see or feel all the sensory impressions the world has to offer. As MacNeice puts it, everything insists on being “various,” making it hard to pin down.","The room was suddenly rich and the great bay-window was
Spawning snow and pink roses against it
Soundlessly collateral and incompatible:
World is suddener than we fancy it.

World is crazier and more of it than we think,
Incorrigibly plural. I peel and portion
A tangerine and spit the pips and feel
The drunkenness of things being various.

And the fire flames with a bubbling sound for world
Is more spiteful and gay than one supposes— 
On the tongue on the eyes on the ears in the palms of one's hands—
There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/91395/snow-582b58513ffae
Island Man by Grace Nichols,Grace Nichols,"'Island Man' by Grace Nichols tells of the difference between warm, hopeful island life and the cold, unfeeling world of London. The poem begins with the speaker to give a stream of consciousness depiction of an island and what it is like to wake up there. Everything is calm, the birds and waves are the only sounds one can hear. There are men pushing out their boats to fish, and the sun is defiant in its entry into the sky. In the third stanza, there is a transition, the man is forced to return to London and the grey world of the “North Circular” road. The cars fly past him, as does time. He has to drag himself from one day to the next, there is nothing defiant about this kind of life.","Morning
And Island man wakes up
To the sound of blue surf
In his head
The steady breaking and wombing

Wild seabirds
And fisherman pulling out to sea
The sun surfacing defiantly

From the east
Of his small emerald island
He always comes back groggily groggily

Comes back to sands
Of a grey metallic soar
To surge of wheels
To dull North Circular roar
Muffling muffling
His crumpled pillow waves
Island man heaves himself

Another London day",https://genius.com/Grace-nichols-island-man-annotated
Star-Gazer by Louis Macneice,Louis MacNeice,"Star-Gazer' by Louis Macneice is a beautiful short poem about the nature of time, the universality of life, and the power of memory. In the first stanza of 'Star-Gazer', the speaker begins by recalling a time forty-two years ago when he was running from one side of a train car to another in order to see the light of the stars. He emphasizes their beauty, the power of their light, and the pleasure he takes from knowing anything about them. He goes on to describe their lifespans and allude to his own. The speaker knows that the light from some of the stars won't reach earth until after everyone has died.","Forty-two years ago (to me if to no one else
The number is of some interest) it was a brilliant starry night
And the westward train was empty and had no corridors
So darting from side to side I could catch the unwonted sight
Of those almost intolerably bright
Holes, punched in the sky, which excited me partly because
Of their Latin names and partly because I had read in the textbooks
How very far off they were, it seemed their light
Had left them (some at least) long years before I was.

And this remembering now I mark that what
Light was leaving some of them at least then,
Forty-two years ago, will never arrive
In time for me to catch it, which light when
It does get here may find that there is not
Anyone left alive
To run from side to side in a late night train
Admiring it and adding noughts in vain.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495809-Star-Gazer-by-Louis-MacNeic
The Cross of Snow by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"The Cross of Snow is a very powerful piece in large part because of its honest and straightforward language. Many poets will approach a theme such as immense grief or suffering with an abstract approach, one that captures the emotion by indirectly pointing out how difficult it is to properly express. In this poem, Longfellow speaks plainly about the death of a woman and uses his own feelings to propel the meaning of the poem, using only sparing metaphors to express them.","In the long, sleepless watches of the night,
A gentle face — the face of one long dead —
Looks at me from the wall, where round its head
The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
Here in this room she died; and soul more white
Never through martyrdom of fire was led
To its repose; nor can in books be read
The legend of a life more benedight.
There is a mountain in the distant West
That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
Displays a cross of snow upon its side.
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
And seasons, changeless since the day she died.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/44629/the-cross-of-snow
The Passionate Shepherd to His Love by Christopher Marlowe,Christopher Marlowe,"'The Passionate Shepherd to His Love' by Christopher Marlowe describes the life that a shepherd wishes to create for his lover if she agrees to come and live with him. The poem begins with the speaker asking his lover to come and be with him forever. If she does this simple thing, they will be able to experience all the joy that the world has to offer. They will have all the best in life. He continues on to state that not only will they be happy in their love, but that he will create for her the most lovely of items. He will use the flowers in their new abode to craft pieces of clothing like hats and petticoats. The shepherd will also use the wool from their lambs to make her dresses. He clearly believes that these items of clothing will be enough, along with his love, to entice her to live with him. By the end of the piece, it is not clear whether or not she accepts his offer, but he seems to understand that it is up to her. He has done his best, and is awaiting her answer.","Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon the Rocks,
Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow Rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of Roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;

A belt of straw and Ivy buds,
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

The Shepherds’ Swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me, and be my love.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44675/the-passionate-shepherd-to-his-love
Juan’s Song by Louise Bogan,Louise Bogan,"'Juan's Song' is a title that satirises the common term 'Swan Song', which is a final effort, performance, or gesture that is given just before retirement. In changing this to the phonetically similar 'Juan's', Bogan is mocking the supposed drama of love, downplaying its importance by highlighting the more ridiculous parts. She argues that deep down everyone knows when love isn't working, things not feeling quite right. If this is true, how do people get so shocked and heartbroken at the end of love – she asks the question 'Who is it, then, that love deceives?'.","When beauty breaks and falls asunder
I feel no grief for it, but wonder.
When love, like a frail shell, lies broken,
I keep no chip of it for token.
I never had a man for friend
Who did not know that love must end.
I never had a girl for lover
Who could discern when love was over.

Bermudas by Andrew Marvell,Andrew Marvell,"'Bermudas' by Andrew Marvell presents the scenic beauty of the Bermuda sea as well as the Bermuda islands. 'Bermudas' by Andrew Marvell is a poem about a group of English pilgrims leaving their native land to the Bermuda islands. While they were on the boat sailing on the Bermuda sea, they could see the beautiful island of Bermuda. The poetic persona who narrates the pleasant aspects of the island, says that the island is “far kinder than our own?” It is to them a safe anode far from the religious harangue of their country. It lits their souls and provides them with a new hope. They can practice their religious rites and stay as they wish. There is no one to tell them what they should do or preach. It is a blissful place to start a new journey as they started long ago in their homeland.","Where the remote Bermudas ride
In th’ ocean’s bosom unespy’d,
From a small boat, that row’d along,
The list’ning winds receiv’d this song.

What should we do but sing his praise
That led us through the wat’ry maze
Unto an isle so long unknown,
And yet far kinder than our own?
Where he the huge sea-monsters wracks,
That lift the deep upon their backs,
He lands us on a grassy stage,
Safe from the storm’s and prelates’ rage.
He gave us this eternal spring
Which here enamels everything,
And sends the fowls to us in care,
On daily visits through the air.
He hangs in shades the orange bright,
Like golden lamps in a green night;
And does in the pomegranates close
Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.
He makes the figs our mouths to meet
And throws the melons at our feet,
But apples plants of such a price,
No tree could ever bear them twice.
With cedars, chosen by his hand,
From Lebanon, he stores the land,
And makes the hollow seas that roar
Proclaim the ambergris on shore.
He cast (of which we rather boast)
The Gospel’s pearl upon our coast,
And in these rocks for us did frame
A temple, where to sound his name.
Oh let our voice his praise exalt,
Till it arrive at heaven’s vault;
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may
Echo beyond the Mexic Bay.

Thus sung they in the English boat
An holy and a cheerful note,
And all the way, to guide their chime,
With falling oars they kept the time.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44677/bermudas
O Me! O Life! by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"‘O Me! O Life! by Walt Whitman is a poem where being capable of boosting the quality of “life” is presented through juxtaposed ideas. Specifically, the negatives of “life” are discussed as the forefront thoughts of the poem in striking juxtaposition to the “good” elements of “life” that are offered afterward for a strong contrast. Although there is far more negative said about “life” than positive, the poem still leaves the reader with the notion that while catching the “good” elements might be difficult since they are so rare in comparison to the “poor” details of “life,” embracing them can lead to a “life” where experience and possibility are enough to make “life” a “good” thing.","Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?
Answer.
That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51568/o-me-o-life
In a London Drawing Room by George Eliot,George Eliot,"'In a London Drawing Room' is a summary of the monotony and sameness of the London city landscape from the drawing room of a resident. This speaker's exact location is not specified, making this poem applicable to anyone living anywhere in London at the time. The poem begins with a dark description of what is outside the speaker's home. The sky is described as “yellowed” and the houses so drab in their shape and form, as a line of fog. There is nothing in this landscape for one to marvel at or question the nature of. The speaker continues to speak of how the birds do not cast shadows as they fly through the city, the sun is unable to reach them through the thick layer of clouds, smog, and smoke that fills the air. It is like a huge canvas sheet has been placed over the top of the city keeping it in darkness. The poem concludes by relating the quick pace of those walking on the streets to the speed of the cars, carriages, and coaches passing. All appear identical and pause for nothing as they hurry along. The poem concludes by alluding to the state of the city, the lack of warmth and sun, being a punishment placed on the residents.","The sky is cloudy, yellowed by the smoke.
For view there are the houses opposite
Cutting the sky with one long line of wall
Like solid fog: far as the eye can stretch
Monotony of surface & of form
Without a break to hang a guess upon.
No bird can make a shadow as it flies,
For all is shadow, as in ways o'erhung
By thickest canvass, where the golden rays
Are clothed in hemp. No figure lingering
Pauses to feed the hunger of the eye
Or rest a little on the lap of life.
All hurry on & look upon the ground,
Or glance unmarking at the passers by
The wheels are hurrying too, cabs, carriages
All closed, in multiplied identity.
The world seems one huge prison-house & court
Where men are punished at the slightest cost,
With lowest rate of colour, warmth & joy.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/47459/in-a-london-drawingroom
next to of course god america i by E.E. Cummings,E.E. Cummings,"“next to of course god america i” is an anti-war poem that touches on the dangers of empty patriotism. The poem’s main speaker—who seems to be addressing a crowd or audience of some sort—imitates the gung-ho, unflinching patriotism that was popular in the United States during and after World War I, but this speech is filled with shallow, rambling clichés and empty platitudes. As a result, the poem becomes a parody of patriotism itself, framing certain forms of national pride as misguided and thoughtless. More specifically, the poem suggests that mindless patriotism often leads to violence, since it can fuel enthusiasm for war.","“next to of course god america i
love you land of the pilgrims’ and so forth oh
say can you see by the dawn’s early my
country ’tis of centuries come and go
and are no more what of it we should worry
in every language even deafanddumb
thy sons acclaim your glorious name by gorry
by jingo by gee by gosh by gum
why talk of beauty what could be more beaut-
iful than these heroic happy dead
who rushed like lions to the roaring slaughter
they did not stop to think they died instead
then shall the voice of liberty be mute?”

The Lake Isle by Ezra Pound,Ezra Pound,"The Lake Isle' by Ezra Pound speaks on the simple things in life and how those things if one were dedicated to them, would make life better. The poem begins with the speaker asking the gods, as he does multiple times in the text, to give him something. This time it is a tobacco shop. This simple building and business represent something larger in the poem—a freedom and escape from the bustling modern world of endless commerce and industrial advancement. As the poem progresses Pound's speaker asks for other things, many of which would obviously be contained within his shop. In conclusion, the speaker who has begun to sound more and more like Pound himself, asks that the gods do something, anything, to remove him from his “damn'd profession of writing”.","O God, O Venus, O Mercury, patron of thieves,
Give me in due time, I beseech you, a little tobacco-shop,
With the little bright boxes
piled up neatly upon the shelves
And the loose fragment cavendish
and the shag,
And the bright Virginia
loose under the bright glass cases,
And a pair of scales
not too greasy,
And the votailles dropping in for a word or two in passing,
For a flip word, and to tidy their hair a bit.
O God, O Venus, O Mercury, patron of thieves,
Lend me a little tobacco-shop,
or install me in any profession
Save this damn'd profession of writing,
where one needs one's brains all the time.",https://allpoetry.com/The-Lake-Isle
Love Cycle by Chinua Achebe,Chinua Achebe,"'Love Cycle' opens by describing the actions of the sun at dawn. At this time, the poem compares the interaction between the sun and Earth to the aftermath of dispassionate sex between a couple. It goes on to describe the harshness of the sun as dawn gives way to noon. Here, Love Cycle relates the earth's endurance of the sun's scorching rays to the forbearance of a woman dissatisfied by her partner. Towards the end, however, it speculates why she (Earth) remains in a relationship with him (the sun), and therefore why this natural phenomenon reoccurs. Love Cycle concludes by implicitly mentioning moonlight, a gentle reflection of the sun's rays. The subdued nature of the sun at night gives Earth free reign over her partner. Love Cycle points to this moment as the reason she stays.","At dawn slowly
the sun withdraws his
long misty arms of
embrace. Happy lovers

whose exertions leave
no aftertaste nor slush
of love’s combustion; Earth
perfumed in dewdrop
fragrance wakes

to whispers of
soft-eyed light…
Later he
will wear out his temper
ploughing the vast acres
of heaven and take it

out of her in burning
darts of anger. Long
accustomed to such caprice
she waits patiently

for evening when thoughts
of another night will
restore his mellowness
and her power
over him.",https://www.best-poems.net/chinua-achebe/love-cycle.html
A Dream Girl by Carl Sandburg,Carl Sandburg,"'A Dream Girl' is a poem about wishing for love, and the anxiety that we may not be able to find it The poem begins with the narrator describing the beautiful woman he hopes will one day come into his life. The woman he envisions is kind, loving, and graceful. He utilizes nature imagery to create an almost nymph-like image in the mind of the reader. He imagines that this woman will enter his life and bring him nothing but joy and happiness. However, in the last stanza, the narrator admits that he knows it is possible that he will never meet this woman. He is also aware that it is possible they will cross paths but not end up together. While he dreams of one day finding his dream woman, he knows it is very possible that it will not happen.","YOU will come one day in a waver of love,
Tender as dew, impetuous as rain,
The tan of the sun will be on your skin,
The purr of the breeze in your murmuring speech,
You will pose with a hill-flower grace.
You will come, with your slim, expressive arms,
A poise of the head no sculptor has caught
And nuances spoken with shoulder and neck,
Your face in a pass-and-repass of moods
As many as skies in delicate change
Of cloud and blue and flimmering sun.
Yet,
You may not come, O girl of a dream,
We may but pass as the world goes by
And take from a look of eyes into eyes,
A film of hope and a memoried day.",http://carl-sandburg.com/dream_girl.htm
A Caution to Everybody by Ogden Nash,Ogden Nash,"'A Caution to Everybody' by Ogden Nash alludes to the possible downfall of humankind if we “forget” who we are at our hearts. The poem is quite short, at only four lines, but in these four lines, the speaker describes an “auk” who he says forgot how to fly when it learned to walk. This, he sees, is comparable to what's happening to humanity. He cautions everyone reading the poem, and everyone else in the world, that if humankind forgets the basics of human life, then we too may become extinct.","Consider the auk;
Becoming extinct because he forgot how to fly, and could only walk.
Consider man, who may well become extinct
Because he forgot how to walk and learned how to fly before he thinked.",https://allpoetry.com/A-Caution-To-Everybody
Half-Past Two by U. A. Fanthorpe,U.A. Fanthorpe,"Half-Past Two' by U.A. Fanthorpe is a clever poem told from the perspective of a young child. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker, a child, describes how a child did “something very wrong.” Their teacher told them this was the case and that they had to stay after school till “half-past two.” But, it is soon revealed that the teacher had never taught the child time and therefore he had no concept of it. All he knew were phrases like “Gettinguptime” and “timeyouwereofftime.” The clock meant nothing to him. So he waited, outside of time, and unbothered. Finally, after forgetting about him, the teacher finds him again and sends him home. ","Once upon a schooltime
He did Something Very Wrong
(I forget what it was).

And She said he’d done
Something Very Wrong, and must
Stay in the school-room till half-past two.

(Being cross, she’d forgotten
She hadn’t taught him Time.
He was too scared at being wicked to remind her.)
He knew a lot of time: he knew
Gettinguptime, timeyouwereofftime,
Timetogohomenowtime, TVtime,

Timeformykisstime (that was Grantime).
All the important times he knew,
But not half-past two.

He knew the clockface, the little eyes
And two long legs for walking,
But he couldn’t click its language,

So he waited, beyond onceupona,
Out of reach of all the timefors,
And knew he’d escaped for ever

Into the smell of old chrysanthemums on Her desk,
Into the silent noise his hangnail made,
Into the air outside the window, into ever.

And then, My goodness, she said,
Scuttling in, I forgot all about you.
Run along or you’ll be late.

So she slotted him back into schooltime,
And he got home in time for teatime,
Nexttime, notimeforthatnowtime,
But he never forgot how once by not knowing time,
He escaped into the clockless land for ever,
Where time hides tick-less waiting to be born.",https://genius.com/U-a-fanthorpe-half-past-two-annotated
Design by Robert Frost,Robert Frost,"'Design' by Robert Frost depicts creation at the hands of a malevolent creator who designed the world with “death and blight” in mind. The poem begins with the speaker discussing a spider and moth he found on the top of a flower. They came together there, as if kindred spirits, in order for the spider to eat the moth. He wonders over this convergence and equates it to a witch's brew. There are a few light-hearted lines in which the speaker plays with potion-related imagery. He then transitions in the sestet to discuss design, creation, more broadly, God.","I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
On a white heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth--
Assorted characters of death and blight
Mixed ready to begin the morning right,
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth--
A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,
And dead wings carried like a paper kite.

What had that flower to do with being white,
The wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
What brought the kindred spider to that height,
Then steered the white moth thither in the night?
What but design of darkness to appall?--
If design govern in a thing so small.",https://poets.org/poem/design
Still Here by Langston Hughes,Langston Hughes,"Still here by Langston Hughes is a poem that is grounded in varying grammar concepts to indicate weariness through struggle and clarity after the struggle concludes. The confusion of the struggle is presented in a juxtaposed format, coming just before the certain finale of victory, and the overall idea is that staying strong through the problems is worth that concluding victory and empowerment.","I been scarred and battered.
My hopes the wind done scattered.
Snow has friz me,
Sun has baked me,
Looks like between 'em they done
Tried to make me

The Prisoner by Emily Brontë,Emily Brontë,"The Prisoner' by Emily Brontë describes an interaction between the speaker, a prison warden, and a captive held within a dungeon crypt. The poem begins with the speaker describing how he went down into the dungeons. He commanded the doors be opened and he looked in on the darkness. The speaker clearly has some authority here and maintains that as he addresses the warder. From this point on the majority of the narrative is focused around one “captive” held in the dungeon. This person is a young woman who appears pure, beautiful, and unconcerned by her situation. In warder is bothered by the woman's appearance. She is not as downtrodden as she should be. The woman speaks to the listener and the warder. She tells them that she is not unhappy, as she knows she won't be trapped in this place forever. Soon, she will be set free. When she is questioned about how this could be the case, she tells about her nightly visits. As she sleeps she is visited by Hope. It tells her that her short life will be rewarded in Heaven. This fact keeps her in good spirits. She does not see the point in crying or mourning as it will not save her or her imprisoned “kindred.” The following sections are used to describe the details of her dreams. They show her what her life will be like in heaven. There will be mute sounds that soothe her. All knowledge will be revealed and truths shown. The poem concludes with the speaker mourning the moments she returns to her waking life. They bring her a great deal of pain. The last lines show that the speaker has a new understanding of his captive. He has also seen that man's rule can be “overuled” by heaven.

Year after year in gloom and desolate despair;
A messenger of Hope comes every night to me,
And offers for short life, eternal liberty.

He comes with Western winds, with evening's wandering airs,
With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars:
Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire,
And visions rise, and change, that kill me with desire.

Desire for nothing known in my maturer years,
When Joy grew mad with awe, at counting future tears:
When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes warm,
I knew not whence they came, from sun or thunder-storm.

But first, a hush of peace—a soundless calm descends;
The struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends.
Mute music soothes my breast—unutter'd harmony
That I could never dream, till Earth was lost to me.

Then dawns the Invisible; the Unseen its truth reveals;
My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels;
Its wings are almost free—its home, its harbour found,
Measuring the gulf, it stoops, and dares the final bound.

O dreadful is the check—intense the agony—
When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see;
When the pulse begins to throb—the brain to think again—
The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.

Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less;
The more that anguish racks, the earlier it will bless;
And robed in fires of hell, or bright with heavenly shine,
If it but herald Death, the vision is divine.",https://englishverse.com/poems/the_prisoner
I Thought a Tree Dying by Sandra Doller,Sandra Doller,"'I Thought a Tree Dying' by Sandra Doller reflects on curious aspects of human life. The strangeness of growing up, death, pets, and trees are all touched on by the poet. Doller begins by focusing on a tree dying, the reason behind this astounding her. This then naturally follows on to the death of other things, like dogs. If dogs die in only a fraction of human life, are humans then the pets of trees, that live much longer than us? Many rhetorical questions are asked throughout the poem, Doller not sure where to point her curiosity. The poet then moves through the intricacy of language, finally settling on the realization that she has grown up.","I thought a tree dying was a sign of pestilence or terror or you’d done something wrong in your life and so your tree died. But no, sometimes, like a pet, they just go. Lifespan different than a dog, how unfair is that, you just get your dog for only this little finger of time and then move on. Whose pets are we? If the lifespan of a tree is significantly longer than ours, does that make us its pet? Like in the concentric circle of lifespans, who wins that contest and is that how you decided to make god a thing? Who am I asking all these questions of, my mother? I am the mother now and have to come up with answers like the way one letter from the word “now” to “not” changes everything: your breakfast is now ready, your breakfast is not ready. Why don’t we speak typos. At the level of the letter. It’s when I saw my hand holding the baby’s head I realized I wasn’t the baby anymore.","poetryfoundation.org/poems/151562/i-thought-a-tree-dying#:~:text=I%20thought%20a%20tree%20dying%20was%20a%20sign%20of%20pestilence,time%20and%20then%20move%20on."
The Collar by George Herbert,George Herbert,"'The Collar' by George Herbert describes a speaker's desire to escape from his religious life and turn to one of greater freedom. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he will stand for his present life no longer. It is time for him to make a change and he intends to resurrect the parts of himself the lost in his youth. He will seek out real pleasures and no longer worry about what is right and wrong. As the poem continues, the extent of his confinement is revealed. He has crafted a prison for himself out of his own belief. The ropes will no longer keep him and he will utilize his fears to his own benefit. He will be a stronger man. The final lines bring the speaker back to his religious reality. The voice of God penetrates through his “rav[ing]” and calms his ardor. He will not do as he said he would; he has been taken back into the fold of the church.","I struck the board, and cried, ""No more;
I will abroad!
What? shall I ever sigh and pine?
My lines and life are free, free as the road,
Loose as the wind, as large as store.
Shall I be still in suit?
Have I no harvest but a thorn
To let me blood, and not restore
What I have lost with cordial fruit?
Sure there was wine
Before my sighs did dry it; there was corn
Before my tears did drown it.
Is the year only lost to me?
Have I no bays to crown it,
No flowers, no garlands gay? All blasted?
All wasted?
Not so, my heart; but there is fruit,
And thou hast hands.
Recover all thy sigh-blown age
On double pleasures: leave thy cold dispute
Of what is fit and not. Forsake thy cage,
Thy rope of sands,
Which petty thoughts have made, and made to thee
Good cable, to enforce and draw,
And be thy law,
While thou didst wink and wouldst not see.
Away! take heed;
I will abroad.
Call in thy death's-head there; tie up thy fears;
He that forbears
To suit and serve his need
Deserves his load.""
But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild
At every word,
Methought I heard one calling, Child!
And I replied My Lord.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/44360/the-collar
"Easter, 1916 by William Butler Yeats",William Butler Yeats,"Easter, 1916 opens with Yeats remembering the rebels as he passed them on the street. Before the Rising, they were just ordinary people who worked in shops and offices. He remembers his childhood friend Constance Markievicz, who is “that woman”; the Irish language teacher Padraic Pearse, who “kept a school” called St. Enda's; the poet Thomas MacDonagh “helper and friend” to Pearse; and even Yeats's own rival in love John MacBride, “a drunken, vainglorious lout.” After reflecting on the rebels' constancy of purpose, as if their hearts were “enchanted to a stone,” the poet wonders whether the rebellion was worth it. The poem ends on a note of ambivalence and futility, reflecting Yeats's own reluctance to engage in political debate. The poem is divided into four stanzas, symbolizing the month of April, the fourth month. It is known for its famous refrain, “All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.”","I have met them at close of day Coming with vivid faces
From counter or desk among grey Eighteenth-century houses.
I have passed with a nod of the head Or polite meaningless words, Or have lingered awhile and said Polite meaningless words,
And thought before I had done Of a mocking tale or a gibe To please a companion
Around the fire at the club, Being certain that they and I But lived where motley is worn: All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.
That woman's days were spent In ignorant good-will,
Her nights in argument
Until her voice grew shrill.
What voice more sweet than hers When, young and beautiful, She rode to harriers?
This man had kept a school And rode our wingèd horse; This other his helper and friend Was coming into his force;
He might have won fame in the end, So sensitive his nature seemed, So daring and sweet his thought.
This other man I had dreamed
A drunken, vainglorious lout.
He had done most bitter wrong
To some who are near my heart, Yet I number him in the song;
He, too, has resigned his part
In the casual comedy;
He, too, has been changed in his turn, Transformed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.
Hearts with one purpose alone Through summer and winter seem Enchanted to a stone
To trouble the living stream.
The horse that comes from the road, The rider, the birds that range From cloud to tumbling cloud, Minute by minute they change; A shadow of cloud on the stream Changes minute by minute; A horse-hoof slides on the brim, And a horse plashes within it; The long-legged moor-hens dive, And hens to moor-cocks call; Minute by minute they live: The stone's in the midst of all.
Too long a sacrifice
Can make a stone of the heart. O when may it suffice?
That is Heaven's part, our part To murmur name upon name, As a mother names her child When sleep at last has come On limbs that had run wild. What is it but nightfall?
No, no, not night but death; Was it needless death after all?
For England may keep faith For all that is done and said. We know their dream; enough
To know they dreamed and are dead; And what if excess of love Bewildered them till they died? I write it out in a verse—
MacDonagh and MacBride And Connolly and Pearse
Now and in time to be,
Wherever green is worn,
Are changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43289/easter-1916
What Were They Like? By Denise Levertov,Denise Levertov,"About Denise Levertov Denise Levertov is well-recognized to combine her own personal experience with historical facts. Through her poetic skills, she is able to build up a new poetic vision. The poet was also influenced by Charles Olson's essay “Projective Verse,” published in 1950, in which the entire focus remains on “the possibilities of breath” and the kinetics of a poem. However, just as she mediates or translates her personal experience into words, it shows her great poetic skills. It is only by virtue of her poetry that readers are able to familiarize themselves with the poet's experience, and obtain a different level of understanding. In What Were They Like?, Levertov combines the intellectual with the emotional experience, the personal with the public, to come up with what she calls an “inscape.” Levertov, rather than shedding light over the battlefield of the Vietnam War, shifts the readers' attention to the daily life of the Vietnamese. The way she makes use of irony, it makes their lot seem even more disastrous. Remember, the poet produces irony without using a war-like terminology to address the victims, but she employs simple words like “buds,” “lanterns,” “laughter,” “ornament,” and “singing” so that the attention of the readers can be transferred to the everydayness of reality, and turned to the value of all simple things that people like to share in their lives.","Did the people of Viet Nam
use lanterns of stone?
Did they hold ceremonies
to reverence the opening of buds?
Were they inclined to quiet laughter?
Did they use bone and ivory,
jade and silver, for ornament?
Had they an epic poem?
Did they distinguish between speech and singing?

Sir, their light hearts turned to stone.
It is not remembered whether in gardens
stone gardens illumined pleasant ways.
Perhaps they gathered once to delight in blossom,
but after their children were killed
there were no more buds.
Sir, laughter is bitter to the burned mouth.
A dream ago, perhaps. Ornament is for joy.
All the bones were charred.
it is not remembered. Remember,
most were peasants; their life
was in rice and bamboo.
When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddies
and the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,
maybe fathers told their sons old tales.
When bombs smashed those mirrors
there was time only to scream.
There is an echo yet
of their speech which was like a song.
It was reported their singing resembled
the flight of moths in moonlight.
Who can say? It is silent now.",https://allpoetry.com/What-Were-They-Like-
Primer for Blacks by Gwendolyn Brooks,Gwendolyn Brooks,"Primer For Blacks' by Gwendolyn Brooks speaks on the necessity of accepting one's black heritage and the unified future that will result from that acceptance. The poem begins with the speaker describing blackness as being both a “commitment” and a “title.” It is what one is referred to as, but is also a promise one makes to “perceive” one's “Glory.” It is necessary for all black people to know their own greatness and worth. The speaker continues on to say that in white culture it is easy to say that it is a great thing to be white, so easy in fact that many black people would say the same. She looks down on this perception and knows that unless that individual belief is changed, nothing else will. She also describes the fact that “Blackness” is like a calling card. It is something that reaches across great distances and unifies all those who even have a drop of black blood. The poem comes to its conclusion with the speaker raising her voice and demanding that all those, no matter how much black blood they have, accept their own race and heritage.","Blackness
is a title,
is a preoccupation,
is a commitment Blacks
are to comprehend—
and in which you are
to perceive your Glory.

The conscious shout
of all that is white is
“It’s Great to be white.”
The conscious shout
of the slack in Black is
'It's Great to be white.'
Thus all that is white
has white strength and yours.

The word Black
has geographic power,
pulls everybody in:
Blacks here—
Blacks there—
Blacks wherever they may be.
And remember, you Blacks, what they told you—
remember your Education:
“one Drop—one Drop
maketh a brand new Black.”
Oh mighty Drop.
______And because they have given us kindly
so many more of our people

Blackness
stretches over the land.
Blackness—
the Black of it,
the rust-red of it,
the milk and cream of it,
the tan and yellow-tan of it,
the deep-brown middle-brown high-brown of it,
the “olive” and ochre of it—
Blackness
marches on.

The huge, the pungent object of our prime out-ride
is to Comprehend,
to salute and to Love the fact that we are Black,
which is our “ultimate Reality,”
which is the lone ground
from which our meaningful metamorphosis,
from which our prosperous staccato,

Hours by Hazel Hall,Hazel Hall,"'Hours' by Hazel Hall describes how hours are experienced like “cities,” “forbidden music” and in “mellow[er] tones” The poem begins with the speaker stating that she has lived through hours that have been “built like cities.” These periods of her life felt endless and mundane. They were as repetitive and unchanging as “grey house[s]” on grey houses. In amongst the city of hours, there were streets which trailed off into a “field of green.” There used to be a way out of the maze of buildings, but it has long since been forgotten. The second stanza describes another period experienced by the speaker. This is one of longing and eternal disappointment. She describes these times as the “white crests” of mountains peeking through the clouds. They are “forbidden” to her as they are completely out of her reach. In the final stanza Hall's speaker turns to address time as a whole. She sees it as being a “tapestry of hours.” All of one's positive and negative experiences, as well as those in the future and those which one will never see, are all blended together. There is no way to separate the good from the bad, it is all connected.","I have known hours built like cities,
House on grey house, with streets between
That lead to straggling roads and trail off,
Forgotten in a field of green;

Hours made like mountains lifting
White crests out of the fog and rain,
And woven of forbidden music—
Hours eternal in their pain.

Life is a tapestry of hours
Forever mellowing in tone,
Where all things blend, even the longing
For hours I have never known.",poemhunter.com/poem/hours-12/
Barbie Doll by Marge Piercy,Marge Piercy,"'Barbie Doll' by Marge Piercy tells of the exorbitant and absurd expectations placed on young girls. The poem begins with the birth of a “girlchild” who is immediately given all the toys she will need to learn how to be a good mother and wife. She has a “GE stove” and a baby doll, which requires diaper changes. The girl is immediately being trained in her future subservient role. She enters puberty, and the insults of other children start to wear away at her. They say that she has “a great big nose and fat legs.” These judgments stay with this young woman for the rest of her life. The speaker makes sure to emphasize all of the beautiful qualities this woman possesses, but neither she nor her peers are able to see and appreciate them. All they can see are her supposed “faults.” In the second half of Barbie Doll, worn down by the words of others, the woman cuts off her nose and legs as an offering to the world that has tormented her. She dies and is buried with a reconstructed face and “turn-up nose.” In death, the speaker ironically states, she has found the happy ending all women desire.","This girlchild was born as usual
and presented dolls that did pee-pee
and miniature GE stoves and irons
and wee lipsticks the color of cherry candy.
Then in the magic of puberty, a classmate said:
You have a great big nose and fat legs.

She was healthy, tested intelligent,
possessed strong arms and back,
abundant sexual drive and manual dexterity.
She went to and fro apologizing.
Everyone saw a fat nose on thick legs.

She was advised to play coy,
exhorted to come on hearty,
exercise, diet, smile and wheedle.
Her good nature wore out
like a fan belt.
So she cut off her nose and her legs
and offered them up.

In the casket displayed on satin she lay
with the undertaker's cosmetics painted on,
a turned-up putty nose,
dressed in a pink and white nightie.
Doesn't she look pretty? everyone said.
Consummation at last.
To every woman a happy ending.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/barbie-doll/
On Aging by Maya Angelou,Maya Angelou,"In the first lines of ‘On Aging’ the speaker begins by telling the reader that there is no need for them to come up and talk to her when she’s sitting quietly. Just because she’s quiet, doesn’t mean she needs company. The same request is applied later on in the poem. If she’s struggling to get upstairs, don’t pity her and bring her a rocking chair. She doesn’t want to be treated any differently than when she was young. In fact, she states, she knows she’s the same person she’s always been even though there are a few physical changes The poem concludes with the speaker noting her physical changes but at the same time feeling grateful that she can still breathe at all.","When you see me sitting quietly,
Like a sack left on the shelf,
Don’t think I need your chattering.
I’m listening to myself.
Hold! Stop! Don’t pity me!
Hold! Stop your sympathy!
Understanding if you got it,
Otherwise I’ll do without it!
When my bones are stiff and aching,
And my feet won’t climb the stair,
I will only ask one favor:
Don’t bring me no rocking chair.
When you see me walking, stumbling,
Don’t study and get it wrong.
‘Cause tired don’t mean lazy
And every goodbye ain’t gone.
I’m the same person I was back then,
A little less hair, a little less chin,
A lot less lungs and much less wind.
But ain’t I lucky I can still breathe in.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/on-aging-2/
l(a (A Leaf Falls with Loneliness) by E.E. Cummings,E.E. Cummings,"When glancing over the text, the word “loneliness” can be made out. It exists outside of the parenthesis. It is one word by itself. There are no other words to complete the thought. It stands alone, and is the word “loneliness”. The phrase “a leaf falls” can be found inside of the parenthesis. This creates an image of emptiness and solitude and reflects the written “loneliness” that runs parallel to it. This leaf falls by itself and is not with other leaves. The image of a leaf falling also implies death. The life of the leaf is over for the season. The cold of the winter is soon to come and the chill of the fall has rendered the leaf lifeless. Thus, it falls to the ground by itself. This image is one of loneliness. The phrase existing inside of the word “loneliness” allows the reader to feel the emptiness mention here. The poem also functions visually. The words inside the parenthesis look like a leaf as it sways back and forth in the wind as it falls to the ground. Thus, this is more than just a poem. It is also a work of art made from a few words. The visual qualities of the text allow the reader to experience not only the imagery created by the description of the leaf falling to the ground in loneliness but also to experience the imagery created by the words and the way they are arranged.","l(a

A Dirge by Christina Rossetti,Christina Rossetti,"'A Dirge' by Christina Rossetti is a thoughtful poem that takes the form of a dirge. It is addressed to someone who has passed away. In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker addresses a recently deceased person and asks them why they were born when they were born. They should've come into the world in the midst of life and warmth. Perhaps, in the middle of spring or summer when birds and plants were at their height. In the second stanza, they take a new approach to what they are saying and ask this person why they died when they did. They should've died in winter when the world was dark and gloomy. This would match up with the emotions that the speaker is experiencing.","Why were you born when the snow was falling?
You should have come to the cuckoo’s calling,
Or when grapes are green in the cluster,
Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
For their far off flying
From summer dying.

Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?
You should have died at the apples’ dropping,
When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
And all winds go sighing
For sweet things dying.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50291/a-dirge-56d22d42029d3
Sonnet 68 by Edmund Spenser,Edmund Spenser,"History of Petrarchan Sonnets The 13th century Italy is considered as the origin of sonnets and Dante, the father, dedicated the sonnets to his beloved Beatrice. But Petrarch evolved a new pattern of his own. He made the new sonnets the way to express human feelings. Both Dante and Petrarch idealized love but Petrarch to the earthly plane, vibrating the warm heartbeats of the lover. With the newly evolved Renaissance, the intense love for beauty, both celestial and earthly inculcated into men's minds. As Petrarch was influenced by Renaissance Humanism, his sonnets spoke about the glory of human love. The sonnets are composed of an octave followed by a sestet giving it a sort of revelation. It is like a returning wave.","Most glorious Lord of life, that on this day,
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin:
And having harrow'd hell, didst bring away
Captivity thence captive, us to win:
This joyous day, dear Lord, with joy begin,
And grant that we for whom thou diddest die,
Being with thy dear blood clean wash'd from sin,
May live for ever in felicity.
And that thy love we weighing worthily,
May likewise love thee for the same again:
And for thy sake, that all like dear didst buy,
With love may one another entertain.
So let us love, dear love, like as we ought,
Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45187/amoretti-lxviii-most-glorious-lord-of-life
Before the Birth of One of Her Children by Anne Bradstreet,Anne Bradstreet,"'Before the Birth of One of Her Children' by Anne Bradstreet is a thoughtful piece about the inevitability of death. In the first lines of 'Before the Birth of One of Her Children,' the speaker begins by noting that everything in the world will eventually come to an end. This includes those she loves and the child she's carrying inside her. There is nothing strong enough to stand up against the specter of death. She notes the fact that her husband is probably going to die soon and how she doesn't know whether she's going to die in childbirth. It's a mystery whether she's going to make it through the pregnancy. She's writing this poem as a goodbye to her husband, who she may never get to properly say goodbye to. She hopes that she lives, but she wants him to know that even if she doesn't, she's still his. The speaker also wants her husband to know that she's fine with him remarrying but hopes he still takes care of her children if the new mother is cruel. Finally, she asks that her husband kiss this paper every once in a while to acknowledge the fact that she once loved him (if, of course, she does end up dying).","All things within this fading world hath end, Adversity doth still our joyes attend;
No ties so strong, no friends so dear and sweet, But with death’s parting blow is sure to meet. The sentence past is most irrevocable, A common thing, yet oh inevitable.
How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend, How soon’t may be thy Lot to lose thy friend, We are both ignorant, yet love bids me These farewell lines to recommend to thee, That when that knot’s untied that made us one, I may seem thine, who in effect am none. And if I see not half my dayes that’s due,
What nature would, God grant to yours and you; The many faults that well you know I have Let be interr’d in my oblivious grave; If any worth or virtue were in me, Let that live freshly in thy memory And when thou feel’st no grief, as I no harms, Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms.
And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains Look to my little babes, my dear remains. And if thou love thyself, or loved’st me,
These o protect from step Dames injury.
And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse,
With some sad sighs honour my absent Herse; And kiss this paper for thy loves dear sake,
Who with salt tears this last Farewel did take.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46450/before-the-birth-of-one-of-her-children
The house was still—the room was still by Charlotte Brontë,Charlotte Brontë,"“The house was still—the room was still” by Charlotte Brontë is a fragment of an unfinished work that speaks on freedom and captivity. In the first lines of this piece, the speaker sets the scene. It is June, and the reader is thrust into a still house in which there is a still room. All alone in the room is a canary trapped in a cage. As the sun sets it sings out to the last of the light and warmth. In contrast to the caged bid, there is a free bird on the lilac bush. It heard everything and after pausing, replies. There is some kind of correspondence between the two and the reader is left to wonder about their positions as “free” and “prisoner.”","Twas eventide in June
A caged canary to the sun
Then setting — trilled a tune

A free bird on that lilac bush
Outside the lattice heard
He listened long — there came a hush
He dropped an answering word —

The prisoner to the free replied",https://genius.com/Charlotte-bronte-the-house-was-still-the-room-was-still-annotated
The Old Horse in the City by Vachel Lindsay,Vachel Lindsay,"'The Old Horse in the City' by Vachel Lindsay looks into the mind of a horse longing for freedom from his cruel and negligent masters. Within the poem, the horse discusses the setting, the appearance of the moon, peace, and pain. The men beat the horse until he is “sore” and he determines that one day he's going to “break the halter-rope / And smash the stable-door” and escape. He will run free and see the moon, “a peck of corn” in his mind, and the rest of the world as he didn't before.","The moon’s a peck of corn. It lies
Heaped up for me to eat.
I wish that I might climb the path
And taste that supper sweet.
Men feed me straw and scanty grain
And beat me till I’m sore.
Some day I’ll break the halter-rope
And smash the stable-door,
Run down the street and mount the hill
Just as the corn appears.
I’ve seen it rise at certain times
For years and years and years.",https://allpoetry.com/The-Old-Horse-In-The-City
From Not Him by Wopko Jensma,Wopko Jensma,"‘From Not Him’ by Wopko Jensma tells a story of a father who is rigid in his daily activities regarding the upbringing of his children and involvement with his community, but there are other levels of his personality that exist on much subtler planes—ones the reader might have to search the poem to find. Specifically, his sternness is addressed through fitting examples, standard lowercase letters, and a lack of punctuation, but that is contrasted with the variation seen in the syllables of ‘From Not Him,’ as well as his limited “respect” and the “wiggl[ing of] his toes.” This contrast can be interpreted as a representation of people in general since often people are a blend of stern and flexible, and this simple tale told from the perspective of a child helps to solidify that concept.

","he forbids us to dance
he always leads the church service he has a stable job
he is always on time for work
he never gets drunk he has respects for most people
everybody respects him
we love our daddy
but sometimes i notice
when a kwela blasts from the radio
he wiggles his toes",https://gimmenotes.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/From-Not-Him_-by-Wopko-Jensma.pdf.pdf
The Anniversary by John Donne,John Donne,"Diction & Language As regards the language of the lyric, The Anniversary is simple, much simpler than that of other poems of Donne. There are no difficult allusions and references. He writes in a simple and direct manner. The lyric acquires force and energy, as the poet has succeeded in capturing the very rhythms and accents of spoken speech, as in the line, “When thou and I first one another saw” and the concluding lines of the poem.","All Kings, and all their favourites,
All glory of honours, beauties, wits,
The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,
Is elder by a year now than it was
When thou and I first one another saw:
All other things to their destruction draw,
Only our love hath no decay;
This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,
Running it never runs from us away,
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.
Two graves must hide thine and my corse;
If one might, death were no divorce.
Alas, as well as other Princes, we
(Who Prince enough in one another be)
Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,
Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;
But souls where nothing dwells but love
(All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove
This, or a love increasèd there above,
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.
And then we shall be throughly blessed;
But we no more than all the rest.
Here upon earth we’re Kings, and none but we
Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;
Who is so safe as we? where none can do
Treason to us, except one of us two.
True and false fears let us refrain,
Let us love nobly, and live, and add again
Years and years unto years, till we attain
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50336/the-anniversary-56d22d56d635f
The River by Caroline Anne Bowles,Caroline Anne Bowles,"'The River' by Caroline Anne Bowles is a simple poem in which the poet describes the changing size and metaphorical age of a river. In the first stanza of 'The River,' the poet describes the river as a child. As it grows in size, strength, and determination, it becomes a youth. Then, in the third stanza, it hits its prime where it is stretched to its will width and much calmer. This leads it into its final stage when it flows into the ocean and eternity. In this last stanza, the metaphorical life cycle of the river is completed and it ends up as a symbol for eternity, a religious allusion to God and Heaven.","River, river, little river!

Bright you sparkle on your way;

O’er the yellow pebbles dancing,

Through the flowers and foliage glancing,

Like a child at play.

 

River, river! Swelling river!

On you rush through rough and smooth;

Louder, faster, brawling, leaping.

Over rocks, by rose-banks, sweeping

Like impetuous youth.

 

River, river! Brimming river!

Broad and deep, and still as time;

Seeming still, yet still in motion,

Tending onward to the ocean,

Just like mortal prime.

 

River, river! Headlong river!

Down you dash into the sea,

Sea that line hath never sounded,

Sea that sail hath never rounded,

Like eternity.",https://www.brainkart.com/article/The-River_42196/
Elder’s Waltz by Louise Halfe,Louise Halfe,"'Elder's Waltz' by Louise Halfe is a rhythmic depiction of an important ceremony in the Cree Nation that includes campfires, food and dancing. The poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that grandmother and grandfather are going to dance. Halfe's care for her Cree heritage is seen through the caring and respectful tone of the text. She goes into detail about the atmosphere, mood and complex pieces of clothing the two dancing partners are going to wear. There are campfires burning, muskeg tea boiling, and a variety of references to other indigenous practices that help a reader imagine the scene fully and completely.","Nôhkom and Nimosôm

Of History and Hope by Miller Williams,Miller Williams,"'Of History and Hope' by Miller Williams shows how the history of the nation teaches everybody the lessons of a better future. One should not be unaware of their origin, meaning history. At the inauguration, Williams wanted to show the people of America how their history reflected the zeal for the betterment of the nation. The speaker of the poem, an old and wide voice portraying the poet, expresses their days are about to end. They have achieved what they meant to achieve. Now, the future of America lies in the hands of the children. How one brings up one's child leads to nation-building. Hence, the speaker advises everyone to invest in their budding generation to achieve optimum growth, both socially and economically.","We have memorized America,
how it was born and who we have been and where.
In ceremonies and silence we say the words,
telling the stories, singing the old songs.
We like the places they take us. Mostly we do.
The great and all the anonymous dead are there.
We know the sound of all the sounds we brought.
The rich taste of it is on our tongues.
But where are we going to be, and why, and who?
The disenfranchised dead want to know.
We mean to be the people we meant to be,
to keep on going where we meant to go.

But how do we fashion the future? Who can say how
except in the minds of those who will call it Now?
The children. The children. And how does our garden grow?
With waving hands—oh, rarely in a row—
and flowering faces. And brambles, that we can no longer allow.

Who were many people coming together
cannot become one people falling apart.
Who dreamed for every child an even chance
cannot let luck alone turn doorknobs or not.
Whose law was never so much of the hand as the head
cannot let chaos make its way to the heart.
Who have seen learning struggle from teacher to child
cannot let ignorance spread itself like rot.
We know what we have done and what we have said,
and how we have grown, degree by slow degree,
believing ourselves toward all we have tried to become—
just and compassionate, equal, able, and free.

All this in the hands of children, eyes already set
on a land we never can visit—it isn’t there yet—
but looking through their eyes, we can see
what our long gift to them may come to be.
If we can truly remember, they will not forget.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47107/of-history-and-hope
The Badger by John Clare,John Clare,"Form and Tone The poem is written in three stanzas the first two consists of fourteen lines and the last stanza of twelve. The poem is written in iambic pentameter with a consistent rhyming pattern, using couplets (AABBCC…) although rhyme in contemporary poetry is often used to denote humor or joy, it was more frequently used in classical poetry, even in more somber poetry as is the case with this poem. This is somewhat bleak and chronicles the story of animals being used in badger baiting. A cruel blood sport where a badger is pulled from its home and repeatedly attacked by large dogs is a practice that, whilst illegal, is still occasionally practiced today.","When midnight comes a host of dogs and men
Go out and track the badger to his den,
And put a sack within the hole, and lie
Till the old grunting badger passes by.
He comes an hears - they let the strongest loose.
The old fox gears the noise and drops the goose.
The poacher shoots and hurries from the cry,
And the old hare half wounded buzzes by.
They get a forked stick to bear him down
And clap the dogs and take him to the town,
And bait him all the day with many dogs,
And laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs.
He runs along and bites at all he meets:
They shout and hollo down the noisy streets.

He turns about to face the loud uproar
And drives the rebels to their very door.
The frequent stone is hurled where'er they go;
When badgers fight, then everyone's a foe.
The dogs are clapped and urged to join the fray'
The badger turns and drives them all away.
Though scarcely half as big, demure and small,
He fights with dogs for hours and beats them all.
The heavy mastiff, savage in the fray,
Lies down and licks his feet and turns away.
The bulldog knows his match and waxes cold,
The badger grins and never leaves his hold.
He drives the crowd and follows at their heels
And bites them through—the drunkard swears and reels

The frighted women take the boys away,
The blackguard laughs and hurries on the fray.
He tries to reach the woods, and awkward race,
But sticks and cudgels quickly stop the chase.
He turns again and drives the noisy crowd
And beats the many dogs in noises loud.
He drives away and beats them every one,
And then they loose them all and set them on.
He falls as dead and kicked by boys and men,
Then starts and grins and drives the crowd again;
Till kicked and torn and beaten out he lies
And leaves his hold and crackles, groans, and dies.",http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/john_clare/poems/6859
Friends by Abbie Farwell Brown,Abbie Farwell Brown,"'Friends' by Abbie Farwell Brown describes the way that nature, specifically the Sky, Wind, and Sun can provide comfort if one is willing to let them. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she finds joy and peace in equal measure out in nature. She likes to go and “lie a little while” underneath a specific tree. From her spot there she sees the sky above her, looking down and protecting her. She is also able to enjoy the feeling of the dappled sunlight on her skin and take in the lace-like patterns it produces. In the second half of the poem, she describes the way the “Wind” sneaks up on her and whispers “pretty things” in her ear. Everywhere around her there is a force of nature ready to comfort her if she needs it.","How good to lie a little while
And look up through the tree!
The Sky is like a kind big smile
Bent sweetly over me.
The Sunshine flickers through the lace
Of leaves above my head,
And kisses me upon the face
Like Mother, before bed.
The Wind comes stealing o'er the grass
To whisper pretty things;
And though I cannot see him pass,
I feel his careful wings.
So many gentle Friends are near
Whom one can scarcely see,
A child should never feel a fear,
Wherever he may be.",https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/friends-by-abbie-farwell-brown
I Find no Peace by Thomas Wyatt,Sir Thomas Wyatt,"I Find no Peace,' explores the complex nature of love and its effect on the one who loves. The poet's misery of being in love clear in the contradictory images present. In this poem 'I Find no Peace,' the speaker expresses his misery of being in love through absolutely contradictory ideas. The title which is also the first line begins with his inability to rest despite having no war to fight. His conflicting emotions are present in the way he is optimistic and afraid, ablaze and frozen, soaring yet unable to take off, desires death yet demands strength. He says he has nothing, yet he holds the whole world. Further, he feels there are no locks strong enough to bind or imprison him, yet bound by love in an inescapable prison. Ultimately, he feels that he has no control over his life or death. Also, in love, he sees without his eyes and complains without a tongue. Towards the end of the poem, the speaker seems to be happy despite the paradoxical elements of love.","I find no peace, and all my war is done.
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
And nought I have, and all the world I seize on.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me not—yet can I scape no wise—
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
And my delight is causer of this strife.","poetryfoundation.org/poems/45579/i-find-no-peace#:~:text=I%20find%20no%20peace%2C%20and,the%20world%20I%20seize%20on."
Song by Robert Hass,Robert Hass,"'Song' by Robert Hass depicts an autumn afternoon where a speaker is seen to be cooking for his/her loved ones. In this poem, Hass beautifully depicts an autumn afternoon by using precise images. This poem is not a personal recapitulation of a day. Rather, it is more about the colors of nature and how it displays the internal emotions of the speaker. He is seen cooking for his loved ones. In the first stanza, he describes the natural landscape. Then, the poet goes on to describe the surroundings and the room where the food is served.","Afternoon cooking in the fall sun —
who is more naked
than the man
yelling, "" Hey, I'm home! ""
to an empty house?
thinking because the bay is clear,
the hills in yellow heat,
& scrub oak red in gullies
that great crowds of family
should tumble from the rooms
to throw their bodies on the Papa-body,
I-am-loved.

Cat sleeps in the windowgleam,
dust motes.
On the oak table
filets of sole
stewing in the juice of tangerines,
slices of green pepper
on a bone-white dish.",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/song-447
Ending the Estrangement by Ross Gay,Ross Gay,"'Ending the Estrangement' by Ross Gay concerns a speaker's longing to be united with his mother. In this poem, the poet starts to talk about his mother's sadness that he tries to understand. Somehow he cannot understand what pained his mother when she was alive. Later he tells readers that it was the thoughts of death or dying that made his mother sad. Thereafter, the poet contemplates what it feels like to be dead. Interestingly, it appears a “form of gratitude” to him. Lastly, the speaker of the poem wants to be a hummingbird. Besides, he wishes to imitate its “nectar-questing song” along with his mother in heaven.","from my mother's sadness, which was,
to me, unbearable, until,
it felt to me 
not like what I thought it felt like
to her, and so felt inside myself—like death,
like dying, which I would almost
have rather done, though adding to her sadness
would rather die than do—
but, by sitting still, like what, in fact, it was—
a form of gratitude
which when last it came
drifted like a meadow lit by torches
of cardinal flower, one of whose crimson blooms,
when a hummingbird hovered nearby,
I slipped into my mouth
thereby coaxing the bird
to scrawl on my tongue
its heart's frenzy, its fleet
nectar-questing song,
with whom, with you, dear mother,
I now sing along.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/58760/ending-the-estrangement
Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird by Wallace Stevens,Wallace Stevens,"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird' by Wallace Stevens uses the blackbird as a way to describe the relations between humankind, nature, and emotions. The poem begins with a number of short stanzas, cantos, or sections which place the blackbird as an integral part of the world. It outlasts other creatures in the snow, stands in as a muse for the speaker, and appears in a number of different forms. The bird is made up of more than its simple physiology. It contains beauty, innuendos, and eccentricities which separate it from other creatures. 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird' concludes with the speaker returning to a snowy day in which he can look out at the landscape as see his muse and guardian, within a cedar tree, looking down over his home. The bird is a force on which he can depend. It will always be there, in one form or another, to watch over him.","Among twenty snowy mountains, The only moving thing Was the eye of the blackbird. I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. It was a small part of the pantomime. A man and a woman Are one. A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms; But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying. It was evening all afternoon. It was snowing And it was going to snow. The blackbird sat In the cedar-limbs.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45236/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-blackbird
Song by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,"'Song' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is made up of a speaker's plea that his “heart” remains indoors and not face the brutal real world which is full of trouble and wildness. 'Song' begins with the speaker asking his listener, who is either his own inner being, or a lover of one variety of another, to “stay at home.” This person seems frail to the speaker, as if she cannot live beyond the walls of a home. He asks that she not “wander” as some do, as it is an unhappy and unfulfilling life. He spends an amount of time describing just how unpleasant the lives of wanderers are and how they are never happy, always listless, and continually doubtful of their choices. This is not a life he wants for either himself or his lover. In the final lines, he repeats his previous sentiments and compares his “heart” to that of a bird who might be preyed on by a hawk.","Stay, stay at home, my heart, and rest;
Home-keeping hearts are happiest,
For those that wander they know not where
Are full of trouble and full of care;
To stay at home is best.
Weary and homesick and distressed,
They wander east, they wander west,
And are baffled and beaten and blown about
By the winds of the wilderness of doubt;
To stay at home is best.
Then stay at home, my heart, and rest;
The bird is safest in its nest;
O’er all that flutter their wings and fly
A hawk is hovering in the sky;
To stay at home is best.",https://poets.org/poem/song-11
"Lot’s Wife by Anna Akhmatova, Translated by Richard Wilbur",Anna Akhmatova,"'Lot's Wife' by Anna Akhmatova is a retelling of the biblical story about Lot's wife. 'Lot's Wife' by Anna Akhmatova presents the sad story of Lot's wife in an innovative manner. It seems the poet is actually sensitive about the story in which the poor wife of Lot turned into a statue of salt. Her lonely statue still stands on the “black mountain”. Men trailed by, overlooking it. But the poetic persona can hear the voices from the past. Someone is telling the lady to “look back”. The native people of “Sodom” blessed the marriage of Lot and the lady. However, fate was not in her favor. Her happy moments of married life turned into a lifelong burden of suffering. Inside the statue, the voice seems to be trapped. The poet can hear it. She says, “Yet in my heart I never will deny her,/ who suffered because she chose to turn.” The last line does not sound like regret. It celebrates the feminine perseverance in her heart.","The just man followed then his angel guide
Where he strode on the black highway, hulking and bright;
But a wild grief in his wife’s bosom cried,
Look back. it is not too late for a last sight

Of the red towers of your native Sodom, the square
Where once you sang, the gardens you shall mourn,
And the tall house with empty windows where
You loved your husband and your babes were born.

She turned, and looking on the bitter view
Her eyes were welded shut by mortal pain;
Into transparent salt her body grew.
And her quick feet were rooted in the plain.

Who would waste tears upon her? Is she not
The least of our losses, this unhappy wife?
Yet in my heart she will not be forgot
Who, for a single glance, gave up her life.",https://ruverses.com/anna-akhmatova/lot-s-wife/9252/
Before the Mirror by Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard,Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard,"'Before the Mirror' by Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard describes the life of a woman trapped within her home and the shadows of the world outside. The speaker begins this piece by describing the room in which she is trapped and her curse, like the Lady of Shalott, to sit before a loom and weave only the shadows she sees in her mirror. As the poem continues it becomes clear that the speaker deeply resents knowing what the world can be, and being unable to see it. She wants at least to be able to weave something of interest, or have some control over the life, like Penelope, but that is not to be. She is, or seems to be, eternally trapped within this room with her “web” darkening, and her mirror of shadows.","Now like the Lady of Shalott,
I dwell within an empty room,
And through the day and through the night
I sit before an ancient loom.
And like the Lady of Shalott
I look into a mirror wide,
Where shadows come, and shadows go,
And ply my shuttle as they glide.
Not as she wove the yellow wool,
Ulysses’ wife, Penelope;
By day a queen among her maids,
But in the night a woman, she,
Who, creeping from her lonely couch,
Unraveled all the slender woof;
Or, with a torch, she climbed the towers,
To fire the fagots on the roof!
But weaving with a steady hand
The shadows, whether false or true,
I put aside a doubt which asks
‘Among these phantoms what are you?’
For not with altar, tomb, or urn,
Or long-haired Greek with hollow shield,
Or dark-prowed ship with banks of oars,
Or banquet in the tented field;
Or Norman knight in armor clad,
Waiting a foe where four roads meet;
Or hawk and hound in bosky dell,
Where dame and page in secret greet;
Or rose and lily, bud and flower,
My web is broidered. Nothing bright
Is woven here: the shadows grow
Still darker in the mirror’s light!
And as my web grows darker too,
Accursed seems this empty room;
For still I must forever weave
These phantoms by this ancient loom.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52059/before-the-mirror
Gold by Donald Hall,Donald Hall,"In 'Gold,' Donald Hall describes the old memories stored inside the mind's attic that the speaker revisits often. In this poem, Hall's speaker begins with reference to a number of “golden” things such as the pale gold walls, centers of daisies, and yellow roses. These are meant to symbolize the precious memories the speaker wove with his beloved. Then, he talks about affectionate gestures like “caressing and dozing” to show how they made love. Hall refers to a “golden room” as a metaphor for their love. The room of his glorious past would remain intact even after their death. In the end, the poet says that they left similar golden rooms or remnants within one another. The yellowish aura of the rooms is so bright and wholesome that it would never dim.","Pale gold of the walls, gold
of the centers of daisies, yellow roses
pressing from a clear bowl. All day
we lay on the bed, my hand
stroking the deep
gold of your thighs and your back.
We slept and woke
entering the golden room together,
lay down in it breathing 
quickly, then
slowly again,
caressing and dozing, your hand sleepily
touching my hair now.

We made in those days
tiny identical rooms inside our bodies
which the men who uncover our graves 
will find in a thousand years,
shining and whole.",https://poets.org/poem/gold
Beat! Beat! Drums! by Walt Whitman,Walt Whitman,"Written after the first battle of the Civil War, “Beat! Beat! Drums!” presents war as something all-consuming and disruptive to practically every aspect of daily life. The speaker tells the drums of a military band to sound the alarm of war in a way that will make it impossible to ignore. In doing so, the speaker frames the Civil War—and, in turn, war in general—as a “ruthless force” capable of stopping the country in its tracks. War, the poem implies, affects everything.","Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force,
Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,
Into the school where the scholar is studying,
Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride,
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,
So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Over the traffic of cities—over the rumble of wheels in the streets;
Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,
No bargainers’ bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—would they continue?
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow.

Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!
Make no parley—stop for no expostulation,
Mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer,
Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,
Let not the child’s voice be heard, nor the mother’s entreaties,
Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,
So strong you thump O terrible drums—so loud you bugles blow.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45469/beat-beat-drums
For Annie by Edgar Allan Poe,Edgar Allan Poe,"'For Annie' by Edgar Allan Poe describes the role of “Annie” or Nancy Heywood in the poet's life when he was struggling with the fever called “Living”. This long poem written in the praise of “Annie” presents how the poet felt before his recovery from his mental agony. It was a phase when the poet was like a living dead. If one looked at him they might think him to be a dead person. But when that lady came into his life, he started to recover gradually. For her selfless love and care, he has recovered from that mental ailment. For this reason, Poe expresses his gratitude to his friend, “Annie” to be with him when he needed her the most.","Thank Heaven! the crisis,
The danger, is past,
And the lingering illness
Is over at last—
And the fever called ""Living""
Is conquered at last.

Sadly, I know
I am shorn of my strength,
And no muscle I move
As I lie at full length—
But no matter!—I feel
I am better at length.

And I rest so composedly,
Now, in my bed,
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead—
Might start at beholding me,
Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning,
The sighing and sobbing,
Are quieted now,
With that horrible throbbing
At heart:—ah, that horrible,
Horrible throbbing!

The sickness—the nausea—
The pitiless pain—
Have ceased, with the fever
That maddened my brain—
With the fever called ""Living""
That burned in my brain.

And oh! of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated—the terrible
Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
Of Passion accurst:—
I have drank of a water
That quenches all thirst:—

Of a water that flows,
With a lullaby sound,
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground—
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground.

And ah! let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed;
For man never slept
In a different bed—
And, to sleep, you must slumber
In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes,
Forgetting, or never
Regretting, its roses—
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses:

For now, while so quietly
Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
About it, of pansies—
A rosemary odor,
Commingled with pansies—
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily,
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of Annie—
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of Annie.

She tenderly kissed me,
She fondly caressed,
And then I fell gently
To sleep on her breast—
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished,
She covered me warm,
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm—
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

And I lie so composedly,
Now, in my bed,
(Knowing her love)
That you fancy me dead—
And I rest so contentedly,
Now in my bed
(With her love at my breast).
That you fancy me dead—
That you shudder to look at me,
Thinking me dead:—

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky,
For it sparkles with Annie—
It glows with the light
Of the love of my Annie—
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my Annie.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44887/for-annie
Nocturne: Blue Waves by Laurie Sheck,Laurie Sheck,"'Nocturne: Blue Waves' by Laurie Sheck describes the art of distancing oneself from the daily happenings. This poem begins with a description of a night sky. The brokenness of the images as well as the shadowy scene makes the speaker thoughtful. She opens the gate of her heart and finds herself with her lover. He touches her with his soft, warm hands. But, she can feel nothing except a solitary feeling. She introspects on death and the real value of life. Finally, she gets an answer from a text she read a while ago. It is about separating oneself from the mundane to dissolve into the infinite beauty of the world.","“There are times when the mind
knows no wholeness. It sees the moon broken
in the branches, the finch’s shadow
as something terribly severed, black blood.
As if touch were annihilation.
As when a woman waits in her small room;
her lover enters,
raises his soft hand to her face … They lie down on the clean bed,
lie down on sweetness of pine,
feather pillows, polished wood;
but as he touches her
she pictures the shadow of a woman
burned into a wall, the others
who wandered in stunned silence
through the streets, their flesh
turned to rags in their hands.
She thinks of the woman’s arms
outstretched though they held nothing,
though there was nothing to hold onto up ahead … She gets up from the bed.
It is dark now,
the man’s throat
caged in shadows of branches as he sleeps.
Distance is the soul of the beautiful,
she had read, and she imagines an unknown planet
revolving in deep space, blue waves
in tender exile from the land.
Remorseless. Without witness.
If she could go there
she would possess nothing.
How beautiful the eart
might seem again from that distance.
How possible love.”",https://ashorthistoryofwords-blog.tumblr.com/post/51815449755/liminality
The Swan by John Gould Fletcher,John Gould Fletcher,"'The Swan' by John Gould Fletcher describes the movements of a swan within a body of water and a desire to escape the realities of life. In the first section of the poem, the speaker begins by describing a creature, the swan, which is only named in the sixth line of the poem. The swan is living amongst a “bronze,” autumn landscape that contains numerous beech trees dipping their branches into a body of water. The swan is described as having a red-tipped head and wings and being able to glide through the water like a sailing ship. It is creating “furrows” in the water as it moves, impacting all the surrounding life. In the final stanzas, the speaker states that the swan is headed off into the distance where there are a number of “great towers,” presumably a city. The speaker admits that if he could he would join the bird in its journey and relish the pleasure of watching the hills in the distance make way for them.","Under a wall of bronze,
Where beeches dip and trail
Their branches in the water;
With red-tipped head and wings—
A beaked ship under sail—
There glides a single swan.

Under the autumn trees
He goes. The branches quiver,
Dance in the wraith-like water,
Which ripples beneath the sedge
With the slackening furrow that glides
In his wake when he is gone:
The beeches bow dark heads.

Into the windless dusk,
Where in mist great towers stand
Guarding a lonely strand,
That is bodiless and dim,
He speeds with easy stride;
And I would go beside,
Till the low brown hills divide
At last, for me and him.",https://poets.org/poem/swan-0
Walking the Dog by Howard Nemerov,Howard Nemerov,"'Walking the Dog' by Howard Nemerov contains a description of the poet walking his dog and the commonalities they share. The poem starts with the speaker talking about how he and his dog inhabit separate universes. The only thing they can communicate through is love. The dog sees and smells things his owner never will. As the poem progresses, Nemerov uses an amusing image of the two as poop connoisseurs, having seen every type of animal droppings in existence as they walk and sniff their way through the streets. The poem ends with the speaker announcing that he wrote this poem after returning home to prove he's in charge.","Two universes mosey down the street
Connected by love and a leash and nothing else.
Mostly I look at lamplight through the leaves
While he mooches along with tail up and snout down,
Getting a secret knowledge through the nose
Almost entirely hidden from my sight.
We stand while he's enraptured by a bush
Till I can't stand our standing any more
And haul him off; for our relationship
Is patience balancing to this side tug
And that side drag; a pair of symbionts
Contented not to think each other's thoughts.

What else we have in common's what he taught,
Our interest in shit. We know its every state
From steaming fresh through stink to nature's way
Of sluicing it downstreet dissolved in rain
Or drying it to dust that blows away.
We move along the street inspecting shit.

His sense of it is keener far than mine,
And only when he finds the place precise
He signifies by sniffing urgently
And circles thrice about, and squats, and shits,
Whereon we both with dignity walk home
And just to show who's master I write the poem.",https://www.blueridgejournal.com/poems/hn-walk.htm
a song in the front yard by Gwendolyn Brooks,Gwendolyn Brooks,"'a song in the front yard' by Gwendolyn Brooks is an interesting poem that explores the speaker's desire to see a darker side of life. The young speaker begins by comparing her front yard to the life she's living and her backyard and the adjoining alley to the kind of life she wants to experience. She's jealous of the freedom the charity children have. It's something she'd like for herself, even if it does come with implications of future crimes and bad behavior. Her mother doesn't approve of these kids, but that doesn't deter the speaker from dreaming about a life as a “bad woman.”","I’ve stayed in the front yard all my life.
I want a peek at the back
Where it’s rough and untended and hungry weed grows. A girl gets sick of a rose.
I want to go in the back yard now And maybe down the alley,
To where the charity children play. I want a good time today.
They do some wonderful things.
They have some wonderful fun.
My mother sneers, but I say it’s fine
How they don’t have to go in at quarter to nine. My mother, she tells me that Johnnie Mae Will grow up to be a bad woman.
That George’ll be taken to Jail soon or late
(On account of last winter he sold our back gate).
But I say it’s fine. Honest, I do.
And I’d like to be a bad woman, too,
And wear the brave stockings of night-black lace And strut down the streets with paint on my face.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/43310/a-song-in-the-front-yard
No Second Troy by William Butler Yeats,William Butler Yeats,"The poem opens on a sad note that Maud Gonne rejected the poet’s love proposal and filled him with misery but then takes a turn to question her revolutionary and violent methods which she preached to the people of Ireland to free their country from British subjugation. The title of the poem, ‘No Second Troy,’ reminds the readers of the “Helen Of Troy” which was destroyed and burnt down at the end of a ten-year war. It points to the contrast between the Homeric times when there was the beautiful city of Troy and the times of “an age like this” when there is no second Troy to be destroyed and burnt down.","Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
What could have made her peaceful with a mind
That nobleness made simple as a fire,
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern?
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49772/no-second-troy
All Hallows’ Eve by Dorothea Tanning,Dorothea Tanning,"All Hallows' Eve' by Dorothea Tanning is a disturbing, multilayered poem that discusses the effects and terrors of domestic abuse. The poem takes the reader through a series of violent images that depict an abusive relationship between a male/female newlywed couple. Although the narrative is not clearly defined, there are certain poignant moments that inform the reader of the dynamic between the two. The woman does what she can to control her husband's anger. She tries to make herself as perfect as possible or face the “werewolf” that she married.","Be perfect, make it otherwise.
Yesterday is torn in shreds.
Lightning’s thousand sulfur eyes
Rip apart the breathing beds.
Hear bones crack and pulverize.
Doom creeps in on rubber treads.
Countless overwrought housewives,
Minds unraveling like threads,
Try lipstick shades to tranquilize
Fears of age and general dreads.
Sit tight, be perfect, swat the spies,
Don’t take faucets for fountainheads.
Drink tasty antidotes. Otherwise
You and the werewolf: newlyweds.",https://www.poetryoutloud.org/poem/all-hallows-eve/
The Butterfly by Pavel Friedmann,Pavel Friedmann,"The Butterfly' by Pavel Friedmann is a beautiful and haunting poem that uses the image of a butterfly to symbolize the loss of freedom. The poem is brief, swiftly taking the reader into the world of the speaker and the fear and terror of the new world that has found himself in. Living in a ghetto in Nazi Germany the speaker has seen his last butterfly. It rose up and out of sight, away from the darkness all around him.","He was the last. Truly the last.
Such yellowness was bitter and blinding
Like the sun’s tear shattered on stone.
That was his true colour.
And how easily he climbed, and how high,
Certainly, climbing, he wanted
To kiss the last of my world.

I have been here seven weeks,
‘Ghettoized’.
Who loved me have found me,
Daisies call to me,
And the branches also of the white chestnut in the yard.
But I haven’t seen a butterfly here.
That last one was the last one.
There are no butterflies, here, in the ghetto.",https://www.hmd.org.uk/resource/the-butterfly-by-pavel-friedmann/
Mr. Nobody by Anonymous,Anonymous,"'Mr. Nobody' by Anonymous is a children's poem first published in 1947. It describes the various mischievous acts of Mr. Nobody. In the first stanza of this poem, the speaker notes that there is a “funny little man” who is as quiet as a mouse who lives within every home. It is this Mr. Nobody who is responsible for broken plates, leaving doors open, putting damp wood on the fire, bringing mud into the house, misplacing the morning paper, and leaving the blinds open. These simple mistakes, acts of mischief, and messes are all everyday occurrences that are sources of trouble for children. The poem takes a clever approach to the idea of a child shifting the blame for breaking a plate over to “Mr. Nobody.”","I know a funny little man,
As quiet as a mouse,
Who does the mischief that is done
In everybody’s house!
There’s no one ever sees his face,
And yet we all agree
That every plate we break was cracked
By Mr. Nobody.
’Tis he who always tears out books,
Who leaves the door ajar,
He pulls the buttons from our shirts,
And scatters pins afar;
That squeaking door will always squeak,
For prithee, don’t you see,
We leave the oiling to be done
By Mr. Nobody.
He puts damp wood upon the fire
That kettles cannot boil;
His are the feet that bring in mud,
And all the carpets soil.
The papers always are mislaid;
Who had them last, but he?
There’s no one tosses them about
But Mr. Nobody.
The finger marks upon the door
By none of us are made;
We never leave the blinds unclosed,
To let the curtains fade.
The ink we never spill; the boots
That lying round you see
Are not our boots,—they all belong
To Mr. Nobody.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42914/mr-nobody
A Subaltern by Siegfried Sassoon,Siegfried Sassoon,"Written in the first person, there is clearly a close relationship between the two men in 'A Subaltern.' In the first stanza, the subaltern confides in the speaker about the “bloody time” he is having in the war. The speaker observes him almost lovingly, detailing his beauty which appears in sharp contrast to the undeniable horror and bleakness around them. In the second stanza, the moment of genuine connection shared by the two men is broken by the speaker's “stale philosophies” and the subaltern dismisses his words and feelings as “tripe.”","He turned to me with his kind, sleepy gaze
And fresh face slowly brightening to the grin
That sets my memory back to summer days,
With twenty runs to make, and last man in.
He told me he’d been having a bloody time
In trenches, crouching for the crumps to burst,
While squeaking rats scampered across the slime
And the grey palsied weather did its worst.

But as he stamped and shivered in the rain,
My stale philosophies had served him well;
Dreaming about his girl had sent his brain
Blanker than ever—she’d no place in Hell....
‘Good God!’ he laughed, and slowly filled his pipe,
Wondering ‘why he always talked such tripe’.",poemhunter.com/poem/a-subaltern/
Unprofitableness by Henry Vaughan,Henry Vaughan,"'Unprofitableness' by Henry Vaughan is an extended conceit presenting a speaker's unsuccessful efforts to thank God for his fresh and rejuvenating visits. The poem begins with the speaker praising God and his ability to improve the speaker's own state of being. It is clear from the start of 'Unprofitableness' that the narrator has a very low opinion of himself. Even by the end of the poem, when God's light has made him infinitely better, he still isn't good enough to bequeath one leaf or flower to a wreath in heaven.","How rich, O Lord! how fresh thy visits are!
'Twas but just now my bleak leaves hopeless hung
Sullied with dust and mud;
Each snarling blast shot through me, and did share
Their youth, and beauty, cold showers nipt, and wrung
Their spiciness and blood;
But since thou didst in one sweet glance survey
Their sad decays, I flourish, and once more
Breath all perfumes, and spice;
I smell a dew like myrrh, and all the day
Wear in my bosom a full sun; such store
Hath one beam from thy eyes.
But, ah, my God! what fruit hast thou of this?
What one poor leaf did ever I yet fall
To wait upon thy wreath?
Thus thou all day a thankless weed dost dress,
And when th'hast done, a stench or fog is all
The odor I bequeath.",https://allpoetry.com/Unprofitableness
To the Young Wife by Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman,Charlotte Anna Perkins Gilman,"Each stanza, aside from the last, of this poem, begins with a question. The speaker is hoping, through her incessant questioning and probing, to reveal to the “young wife” that her life is not exactly what it seems. She is not the “queen” of a kingdom like she is treated. She is only in charge of a confining house and a stove. The speaker continues to ask the woman if she did not have a better life in mind for herself when she was younger. One in which she could do something meaningful. She also states that until she has become a fuller person, the young wife will not be able to raise her children to the best of her abilities. To the Young Wife concludes by stating that setting out from home to better oneself does not result in a loss of love but the improvement of oneself as a person. This pursuit of passion will allow the young wife to be a better wife and mother. The last lines make clear that it is not her vows which hold her in the home but the unending service she provides to the home. She is able to set herself free.","Are you content, you pretty three-years’ wife?
Are you content and satisfied to live
On what your loving husband loves to give,
And give to him your life?

Are you content with work, — to toil alone,
To clean things dirty and to soil things clean;
To be a kitchen-maid, be called a queen, —
Queen of a cook-stove throne?

Are you content to reign in that small space --
A wooden palace and a yard-fenced land --
With other queens abundant on each hand,
Each fastened in her place?

Are you content to rear your children so?
Untaught yourself, untrained, perplexed, distressed,
Are you so sure your way is always best?
That you can always know?

Have you forgotten how you used to long
In days of ardent girlhood, to be great,
To help the groaning world, to serve the state,
To be so wise — so strong?

And are you quite convinced this is the way,
The only way a woman’s duty lies --
Knowing all women so have shut their eyes?
Seeing the world to-day?

Having no dream of life in fuller store?
Of growing to be more than that you are?
Doing the things you know do better far,
Yet doing others - more?

Losing no love, but finding as you grew
That as you entered upon nobler life
You so became a richer, sweeter wife,
A wiser mother too?

What holds you? Ah, my dear, it is your throne,
Your paltry queenship in that narrow place,
Your antique labours, your restricted space,
Your working all alone!

Be not deceived! ‘Tis not your wifely bond
That holds you, nor the mother’s royal power,
But selfish, slavish service hour by hour --
A life with no beyond!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46061/to-the-young-wife
Amoretti LXVII: Like as a Huntsman by Edmund Spenser,Edmund Spenser,"In this sonnet, titled ‘Amoretti LXVII: Like as a Huntsman,’ Edmund Spenser draws a parallel between a huntsman and his pursuit of prey and his own pursuit of love. The poem explores themes of desire, perseverance, and the surprising nature of love. The huntsman, exhausted from his fruitless chase, finds respite in a shady spot, accompanied by his panting hounds, who have been deprived of their prey. Similarly, the speaker of the poem has engaged in a long and futile pursuit of his beloved, only to abandon it in weariness. However, just as the deer that was being pursued by the huntsman unexpectedly returns to the same location, the speaker’s love interest comes back to him, seemingly with the intention of quenching her thirst at a nearby brook. The deer, upon seeing the speaker, does not attempt to flee but rather remains fearless and steadfast in his presence. The speaker then approaches the deer, who is trembling but does not resist, and he firmly binds her at her own consent. The speaker finds it strange and remarkable to witness a wild animal willingly and beautifully won over.","Like as a huntsman after weary chase,
Seeing the game from him escap'd away,
Sits down to rest him in some shady place,
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:
So after long pursuit and vain assay,
When I all weary had the chase forsook,
The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.
There she beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.
Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,
So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.",https://poemanalysis.com/edmund-spenser/amoretti-lxvii-like-as-a-huntsman/
Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent’s Narrow Room by William Wordsworth,William Wordsworth,"'Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room' by William Wordsworth is about the happiness and peace people find in different ways of life. The first part of the poem lists out a few different people, from a nun to hermit and student. Each lives in a different place and experiences different confides. This life, even if it seems confining to someone else, isn't. It's not really a prison, the poet says. The poem concludes with the poet discussing his own “prison,” the sonnet form. It's something that he finds peace in and he takes pleasure from the fact that a few others may as well.","Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room;
And hermits are contented with their cells;
And students with their pensive citadels;
Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,
Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,
High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,
Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
In truth the prison, into which we doom
Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,
In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound
Within the Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;
Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,
Should find brief solace there, as I have found.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/52299/nuns-fret-not-at-their-convents-narrow-room
She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways by William Wordsworth,William Wordsworth,"In this poem, Wordsworth examines an idealized and unrequited love for Lucy, a girl who has died young.The poem examines loneliness and loss, but also unrecognized beauty and dignity. She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways has three quatrains with simple language (mainly words of one syllable), and it has an ABAB rhyme scheme. Furthermore, Wordsworth’s poem can be read as an elegiac poem, with graceful descriptions and a mourning tone. Thus, She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways’s main theme is death, a death that is described and grieved for throughout the entire poem.","She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love:

A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye!
—Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
The difference to me!",poetryfoundation.org/poems/45549/she-dwelt-among-the-untrodden-ways
The Deserted Garden by Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"'The Deserted Garden' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is a beautiful poem in which the speaker looks back on her childhood. The majority of this poem is spent meditating on the times the speaker spent as a young girl within a deserted garden. There, she contemplated what happened before it fell into disrepair, read books, listened to the thrush sing, and enjoyed her own childhood. Now, she looks back on that time with longing, wishing that she could feel the pleasures of youthful freedom again and regretting that her womanhood did not turn out as happily as she thought it would when she was resting in the mossy grove surrounded by white roses. Now, she's closer to death than she is to the child she used to be. But, she takes comfort from the fact that she'll be headed to Heaven, the place from which nature gets its greenest colors.","I MIND me in the days departed,
How often underneath the sun
With childish bounds I used to run
To a garden long deserted.
The beds and walks were vanish'd quite;
And wheresoe'er had struck the spade,
The greenest grasses Nature laid,
To sanctify her right.
I call'd the place my wilderness,
For no one enter'd there but I.
The sheep look'd in, the grass to espy,
And pass'd it ne'ertheless.
The trees were interwoven wild,
And spread their boughs enough about
To keep both sheep and shepherd out,
But not a happy child.
Adventurous joy it was for me!
I crept beneath the boughs, and found
A circle smooth of mossy ground
Beneath a poplar-tree.
Old garden rose-trees hedged it in,
Bedropt with roses waxen-white,
Well satisfied with dew and light,
And careless to be seen.
Long years ago, it might befall,
When all the garden flowers were trim,
The grave old gardener prided him
On these the most of all.
Some Lady, stately overmuch,
Here moving with a silken noise,
Has blush'd beside them at the voice
That liken'd her to such.
Or these, to make a diadem,
She often may have pluck'd and twined;
Half-smiling as it came to mind,
That few would look at them.
O, little thought that Lady proud,
A child would watch her fair white rose,
When buried lay her whiter brows,
And silk was changed for shroud!—
Nor thought that gardener (full of scorns
For men unlearn'd and simple phrase)
A child would bring it all its praise,
By creeping through the thorns!
To me upon my low moss seat,
Though never a dream the roses sent
Of science or love's compliment,
I ween they smelt as sweet.
It did not move my grief to see
The trace of human step departed:
Because the garden was deserted,
The blither place for me!
Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken
Hath childhood 'twixt the sun and sward:
We draw the moral afterward—
We feel the gladness then.
And gladdest hours for me did glide
In silence at the rose-tree wall:
A thrush made gladness musical
Upon the other side.
Nor he nor I did e'er incline
To peck or pluck the blossoms white:—
How should I know but that they might
Lead lives as glad as mine?
To make my hermit-home complete,
I brought clear water from the spring
Praised in its own low murmuring,
And cresses glossy wet.
And so, I thought, my likeness grew
(Without the melancholy tale)
To 'gentle hermit of the dale,'
And Angelina too.
For oft I read within my nook
Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
Made sounds poetic in the trees,
And then I shut the book.
If I shut this wherein I write,
I hear no more the wind athwart
Those trees, nor feel that childish heart
Delighting in delight.
My childhood from my life is parted,
My footstep from the moss which drew
Its fairy circle round: anew
The garden is deserted.
Another thrush may there rehearse
The madrigals which sweetest are;
No more for me!—myself afar
Do sing a sadder verse.
Ah me! ah me! when erst I lay
In that child's-nest so greenly wrought,
I laugh'd unto myself and thought,
'The time will pass away.'
And still I laugh'd, and did not fear
But that, whene'er was pass'd away
The childish time, some happier play
My womanhood would cheer.
I knew the time would pass away;
And yet, beside the rose-tree wall,
Dear God, how seldom, if at all,
Did I look up to pray!
The time is past: and now that grows
The cypress high among the trees,
And I behold white sepulchres
As well as the white rose,—
When wiser, meeker thoughts are given,
And I have learnt to lift my face,
Reminded how earth's greenest place
The colour draws from heaven,—
It something saith for earthly pain,
But more for heavenly promise free,
That I who was, would shrink to be
That happy child again.",https://englishverse.com/poems/the_deserted_garden
Spring in War Time by Sara Teasdale,Sara Teasdale,"This piece is a series of questions asked by a narrator who is confused about how spring can continue to come, the sun can continue to shine, and plants bloom under the shadow of war. The poem begins with the speaker's sensing of spring far off in the distance, but coming all the same. She asks how “Spring can take heart to come / To a world in grief.” She repeats this pattern in the rest of the stanzas questioning how daylight can persist while men “Still fight,” how grass can grow and wind can blow over “New graves,” and lastly, how apple-blooms can bud where lovers, now parted by death, once walked. In totality, this piece is meant to show that while war is powerful and it seems like it should stop the whole world in its tracks, it cannot. Fighting, and the problems of humans, cannot stop the seasons from changing, grass from growing, or trees from flowering.","I feel the spring far off, far off,
The faint, far scent of bud and leaf—
Oh, how can spring take heart to come
To a world in grief,
Deep grief?
The sun turns north, the days grow long,
Later the evening star grows bright—
How can the daylight linger on
For men to fight,
Still fight?
The grass is waking in the ground,
Soon it will rise and blow in waves—
How can it have the heart to sway
Over the graves,
New graves?
Under the boughs where lovers walked
The apple-blooms will shed their breath—
But what of all the lovers now
Parted by Death,
Grey Death?",poetryfoundation.org/poems/57303/spring-in-war-time
The Death Bed by Siegfried Sassoon,Siegfried Sassoon,"'The Death Bed' by Siegfried Sassoon tells of the suffering and eventual peaceful death of a soldier mortally wounded in World War I. The poem begins with the speaker describing the terrible condition a young soldier is in. The only moments he gets any relief from the pain are those induced by opiates. When asleep, he can drift through his mind on a river. It is a peaceful symbol for death and the afterlife that the young man seems to welcome. As the poem progresses the contrast between his sleeping and waking worlds is further emphasized. When he moves, he is in incredible agony as if a beast jumped on his body and was trying to tear him apart. Eventually, death comes to his side, and decides it is time for him to go. From there, the two depart, and silence falls again over the hospital ward. The last line reminds the reader that the war rages on right outside the hospital. You read the full poem here.","He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped
Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;
Aqueous like floating rays of amber light, 
Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep.
Silence and safety; and his mortal shore
Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.
 
Someone was holding water to his mouth.
He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped
Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot
The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.
Water—calm, sliding green above the weir;
Water—a sky-lit alley for his boat, 
Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers
And shaken hues of summer: drifting down, 
He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.
 
Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,
Blowing the curtain to a gummering curve.
Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars
Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;
Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.
 
Rain—he could hear it rustling through the dark;
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;
Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers
That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps
Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace, 
Gently and slowly washing life away.

He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain
Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.
But someone was beside him; soon he lay
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.
And death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared. 
 
Light many lamps and gather round his bed.
Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.
Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.
He's young; he hated war; how should he die
When cruel old campaigners win safe through?
 
But death replied: “I choose him.” So he went,
And there was silence in the summer night;
Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.
Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/57214/the-death-bed
A Silent Wood by Elizabeth Eleanor Siddal,Elizabeth Eleanor Siddal,"Siddal begins 'A Silent Wood' by addressing the woods in which she is contemplating entering. It is clear from the beginning that this speaker is deep within a depressive state, she speaks clearly on the misery that is within her heart and the fact that it is only intensified by the woods themselves. The plants and creatures she will encounter there do nothing to soothe her, but instead, bring back powerful memories of her experiences in the past. The second stanza elaborates on these emotions and the speaker asks of the wood that she is allowed to sit within its darkest corner. Not only does she wish to inflict further emotional distress on herself by entering the woods, but she also wants to find the darkest part. In addition to this request, she asks that she can find the strength to not “swoon” when she is there. The third stanza is made up of the speaker's description of how she will act when she is there. She will be as a stone, cold and unmoving, but she will not be alone. The final two lines of the piece are a question asked by the speaker, hoping that God can somehow bring back the time in which she and her lover walked in the wood together. This is the first time in which the poem the source of her depression is made clear.","O silent wood, I enter thee
With a heart so full of misery
For all the voices from the trees
And the ferns that cling about my knees.

In thy darkest shadow let me sit
When the grey owls about thee flit;
There will I ask of thee a boon,
That I may not faint or die or swoon.

Gazing through the gloom like one
Whose life and hopes are also done,
Frozen like a thing of stone
I sit in thy shadow – but not alone.

Can God bring back the day when we two stood
Beneath the clinging trees in that dark wood?",https://allpoetry.com/A-Silent-Wood
A Drink of Water by Seamus Heaney,Seamus Heaney,"“A Drink of Water,” the speaker reveals the character of an old woman, who used to fetch water from his well. The poem starts with the usual description of the usual coming of the woman to the well. The poet's use of the verb “came” suggests that the poet was already there to observe it. This old woman's presence gave the poet joy and happiness, as he used to watch her every time. However, in the sestet, the poet moves inside the house, and also from day to night. This shows that Heaney is so familiar with the old woman that he knew all about her. The final line of the poem suggests that the old woman to be his “muse” meaning she gave him the “inspiration”. He “drinks the water as if receiving inspiration” to express his memories and life experiences as a young boy living on a farm in Ireland.","She came every morning to draw water
Like an old bat staggering up the field:
The pump’s whooping cough, the bucket’s clatter
And slow diminuendo as it filled,
Announced her. I recall
Her grey apron, the pocked white enamel
Of the brimming bucket, and the treble
Creak of her voice like the pump’s handle.
Nights when a full moon lifted past her gable
It fell back through her window and would lie
Into the water set out on the table.
Where I have dipped to drink again, to be
Faithful to the admonishment on her cup,
Remember the Giver fading off the lip.",https://fourteenlines.blog/tag/a-drink-of-water-by-seamus-heaney/
Attack by Siegfried Sassoon,Siegfried Sassoon,"'Attack' by Siegfried Sassoon depicts the preparation of a military attack and the struggle of the soldiers in a filthy ambiance. 'Attack' by Siegfried Sassoon is a haunting poem that discusses the reality of war and what happens when a soldier is out on the battlefield. Sassoon transitions between describing the battlefield physically, to describing the soldiers physically and eventually conclude with the feelings of the soldiers. Sassoon builds suspense with every line and uses imagery, personification, and enjambment to capture the reader's attention and as accurately as possible describe the true horrors of being a soldier at war.","At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun 
In the wild purple of the glow'ring sun, 
Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud 
The menacing scarred slope; and, one by one, 
Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire. 
The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed 
With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear, 
Men jostle and climb to, meet the bristling fire. 
Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear, 
They leave their trenches, going over the top, 
While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists, 
And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists, 
Flounders in mud. O Jesus, make it stop!",poetryfoundation.org/poems/57323/attack-56d23aba391f5
Sonnet 29 – Pity Me Not Because the Light of Day by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"The speaker of 'Sonnet 29' is asking the person with whom she is in love to stop pitying her. While the tone throughout the poem is quite melancholy, the speaker also seems to be realistic when it comes to love, comparing the cycles in nature to the cycle of romance. The speaker recognizes and accepts that her lover no longer loves her, and she says that she has always known that this is the way of love. It is fleeting and fickle.","Pity me not because the light of day
At close of day no longer walks the sky;
Pity me not for beauties passed away
From field and thicket as the year goes by;
Pity me not the waning of the moon,
Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,
Nor that a man’s desire is hushed so soon,
And you no longer look with love on me.
This have I known always: Love is no more
Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,
Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore,
Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales:
Pity me that the heart is slow to learn
What the swift mind beholds at every turn.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/148560/pity-me-not-because-the-light-of-day
Big Poppy by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"In 'Big Poppy' Ted Hughes deals with momentary attraction and pleasure that leads the poppy to its impending doom. Using a simple image from nature, he projects the gender differences and the momentariness of emotions that exist in the human world. The 'Big Poppy' on the outset is a simple poem about the poppy flower and the bumble bee's attraction towards the sexuality emanating from the poppy flower. The personified Poppy flower and the Bumblebee demonstrate the sexual attraction between them. The exchange between the flower and the Bee deals with the temporariness of the relationship. The poet's choice of words and tone clarifies that there is no tender love present. However, in the end, the flower's extravagance becomes a villain bringing it to its doom.","Hot-eyed Mafia Queen!
At the trim garden’s edge
She sways towards August.
A Bumble Bee
Clambers into her drunken, fractured goblet –
Up the royal carpet of down-hung,
Shrivel-edged, unhinged petal, her first-about-to-fall.
He’s in there as she sways. He utters thin
Sizzling bleats of difficult enjoyment.
Her carnival paper skirts, luminous near-orange,
Embrace him helplessly.
Already her dark pod is cooking its drug.
Every breath imperils her. Her crucible
Is falling apart with its own fierceness.
A fly, cool, rests on the flame-fringe.
Soon she’ll throw off her skirts
Withering into vestal afterlife,
Bleeding inwardly
Her maternal nectars into her own
Coffin – (cradle of her offspring).
Then we shall say:
She wore herself in her hair, in her day,
And we could see nothing but her huge flop of petal,
Her big, lewd, bold eye, in its sooty lashes,
And that stripped, athletic leg, hairy
In a fling of abandon – ‘",https://theorkneynews.scot/2022/06/01/the-big-poppies-are-back/
A False Step by Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"'A False Step' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is about a woman who disregarded the genuine feelings of a person. The poem begins with a direct address to a “Sweet” lady who had admirable qualities during her youth. She was so blind due to her beauty that she could not understand the feelings of a genuine lover. She hurt her and metaphorically trod upon his “heart.” The poet says it was rather the person's fault who came in her way. At the end, when her physical beauty fades away, she is going to regret her decision. Then she would realize the importance of true love that is not time's fool, a fleeting feeling.","SWEET, thou hast trod on a heart.
Pass! there’s a world full of men;
And women as fair as thou art
Must do such things now and then.
Thou only hast stepped unaware,—
Malice, not one can impute;
And why should a heart have been there
In the way of a fair woman’s foot?
It was not a stone that could trip,
Nor was it a thorn that could rend:
Put up thy proud underlip!
’Twas merely the heart of a friend.
And yet peradventure one day
Thou, sitting alone at the glass,
Remarking the bloom gone away,
Where the smile in its dimplement was,
And seeking around thee in vain
From hundreds who flattered before,
Such a word as,—“Oh, not in the main
Do I hold thee less precious,—but more!”
Thou’lt sigh, very like, on thy part:—
“Of all I have known or can know,
I wish I had only that Heart
I trod upon, ages ago!”",https://www.bartleby.com/lit-hub/library/poem/a-false-step/
Dream Song 29 by John Berryman,John Berryman,"Dream Song 29' by John Berryman is a reality-bending exploration into the mind of “Henry” a terribly sad and troubled man. Throughout this short poem, Berryman's speaker describes Henry's depression as a weight on his heart that he can't get rid of. Even when it fades for a moment, it always comes back when Henry hears, sees, or smells something triggering. The speaker adds another layer to Henry's confusion as he describes the man's perception of himself as a killer. Although he's wrong, Henry continually has to check to make sure that he hasn't killed anyone and chopped up their body. ","There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.
And there is another thing he has in mind
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of. Ghastly,
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late. This is not for tears;
thinking.
But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.
Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
Nobody is ever missing.",https://poets.org/poem/dream-song-29
"Sir, No Man’s Enemy (Petition Poem) by W.H. Auden",W.H. Auden,"The poem, 'Petition,' was composed by Auden in October, 1929. Its earlier title was 'Sir, No Man's Enemy'. It was published in the poetic volume, Poems (1930. It was the last poem in the volume. At the time of its composition, Auden was a psychologist poet. Under the influence of Sigmund Freud, George Groddeck, Homer Lane, John Layard, and D.H. Lawrence, he believed that man's 'psychological ills' were 'greater' than this 'political' ones. His belief can be stated as follows: Sexual love is the main urge in man. It draws man and woman together. If it is allowed a free play, it bursts forth as the Life-force, called Id in man. But there is another force too in man. It is the death instinct, which reflects itself as the fear of death. It lies vested in the faculty of mind and is called the Super-ego. So the belief under which the present poem was composed can be summed up as follows: Modern human culture and civilization have systematically repressed sexual love in man and in society for ages and ages. The result is that society is ruled by morals and laws of the Super-ego which is the Death-force to sexual love. In effect, society is ruled by Death-force, and man and society are 'sick', or rather, inhibited by death-wish. Let me tell you here that society and individuals are sick because men and their culture have repressed vital human forces (in themselves). The Super-ego has nearly defeated the 'id' (i.e. Life-force). Cure demands a change of heart, a change in the individuals. The power of the super-ego must be overthrown and the languishing 'id' released from its fetters.'","Sir, no man's enemy, forgiving all
But will his negative inversion, be prodigal:
Send to us power and light, a sovereign touch
Curing the intolerable neural itch,
The exhaustion of weaning, the liar's quinsy,
And the distortions of ingrown virginity.
Prohibit sharply the rehearsed response
And gradually correct the coward's stance;
Cover in time with beams those in retreat
That, spotted, they turn though the reverse were great;
Publish each healer that in city lives
Or country houses at the end of drives;
Harrow the house of the dead; look shining at
New styles of architecture, a change of heart.",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8493025-Petition-by-W-H-Auden
A Dirge Without Music by Edna St. Vincent Millay,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"'A Dirge Without Music' by Edna St. Vincent Millay is a powerful poem about death and loss. The speaker emphasizes that she is not resigned to death even if she knows it will happen to everyone. In the first lines of this poem, the speaker begins by telling readers that she has not resigned herself to the fact that all people, thinkers, and lovers included, eventually end up in the darkness of the earth. All of these people go into the dark with only a little remaining to be remembered. The witty, the intelligent, kind, and all those who have ever done well on earth will end up in the dark, with their body, memories, and spirits, feeding the roses. The poet's speaker continues to resist this fact. She is “not resigned,” meaning she is not giving up when it comes to the idea of death.","I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,
A formula, a phrase remains,—but the best is lost.
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,—
They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52773/dirge-without-music
I do not love you by Pablo Neruda,Pablo Neruda,"Darkness in the Poem One of the most important images in 'I do not love you' is darkness. It comes in a variety of forms, from “Shadow” in the fourth line, to “light…hidden” and “obscure things.” There are continual references to something dark or obscure. This changes the tone of the text, making it more mysterious and even dangerous. It is not clear why Neruda made this choice, but clearly, there is something about the situation that edges him towards the darker side of things. Another detail of note, Neruda uses the second person. He is directly speaking to one person. Considering the fact that the collection in which the poem as included, Love Sonnets, is dedicated to Neruda's wife. This should lead one to believe that Matilde Urrutia is the intended listener.","I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul.

I love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;
so I love you because I know no other way

than this: where I does not exist, nor you,
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.",https://hellopoetry.com/poem/9959/xvii-i-do-not-love-you/
Monuments for a Friendly Girl at a Tenth Grade Party by William Stafford,William Stafford,"'Monuments for a Friendly Girl at a Tenth Grade Party' by William Stafford revolves around the poet's childhood love, Ruth, for whom he builds this “monument” of words. Stafford's descriptive language helps readers imagine a sweet love story between the speaker and Ruth in this poem. The use of words like “relics” and “monuments” makes the poem seem like a special tribute to the girl. In the first stanza, the speaker says that Ruth glanced back at him. It clearly shows that she also felt for the speaker. He also highlights the reason for their parting and wishes her to be safe in heaven. Overall, this poem reflects how the speaker misses her to this very day and wishes if he would have had spent some more “seconds” with her.","The only relics left are those long
spangled seconds our school clock chipped out
when you crossed the social hall
and we found each other alive,
by our glances never to accept our town's
ways, torture for advancement,
nor ever again be prisoners by choice.

Now I learn you died
serving among the natives of Garden City,
Kansas, part of a Peace Corps
before governments thought of it.

Ruth, over the horizon your friends eat
foreign chaff and have addresses like titles,
but for you the crows and hawks patrol
the old river. May they never
forsake you, nor you need monuments
other than this I make, and the one
I hear clocks chip in that world we found.",poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/30514/monuments-for-a-friendly-girl-at-a-tenth-grade-party
Fountain by Elizabeth Jennings,Elizabeth Jennings,"'Fountain' by Elizabeth Jennings is about a fountain that is appreciated for its precise representation of human creativity. The poem begins with an instruction for the reader. Jennings urges the audience not to be taken away by the sound of a fountain. They should wait and let it be. In the second stanza, the poet-speaker gives instructions about how to approach it amidst a full piazza. The third stanza is all about different aspects of a fountain that Jennings appreciates the most.","Let it disturb no more at first

Than the hint of a pool predicted far in a forest,

Or a sea so far away that you have to open

Your window to hear it.

Think of it then as elemental, as being

Necessity,

Not for a cup to be taken to it and not

For lips to linger or eye to receive itself

Back in reflection, simply

As water the patient moon persuades and stirs.

/

And then step closer,

Imagine rivers you might indeed embark on,

Waterfalls where you could

Silence an afternoon by staring but never

See the same tumult twice.

Yes come out of the street and enter

The full piazza. Come where the noise compels.

Statues are bowing down to the breaking air.

/

Observe it there - the fountain, too fast for shadows,

Too wild for the lights which illuminate it to hold,

Even a moment, an ounce of water back;

Stare at such prodigality and consider

It is the elegance here, the taming,

The keeping of a thousand flowering sprays,

That builds this energy up but lets watchers

See in that stress an image of utter calm,

A stillness there. It is how we must have felt

Once at the edge of some perpetual stream,

Fearful of touching, bringing no thirst at all,

Panicked by no perception of ourselves

But drawing the water down to the deepest wonder.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/kzictk/poem_fountain_by_elizabeth_jennings/
Twelve by Lynn Melnick,Lynn Melnick,"Twelve' by Lynn Melnick explores parental love, Melnick protecting her child from the world. Instead of having her child repeat the childhood that Melnick had, she tries to be a better parent. The poem has many delicate moments, Melnick displaying touching instances of parental love. Twelve starts by focusing on what the poet was doing when she 'was your age'. This then moves down to a comparison with the peaceful slumber of her daughter, protected from the world. Melnick moves through more examples, including being letting 'boys' 'claw her carcass' for a 'quarter'. The poet vows to give her daughter a better life, not wanting her to 'know what I know'.","When I was your age I went to a banquet.
When I was your age I went to a barroom

and bought cigarettes with quarters
lifted from the laundry money. Last night

I did all your laundry. I don’t know why
I thought this love could be pure. It’s enough

that it’s infinite. I kiss your cheek when you sleep
and wonder if you feel it.

It’s the same cheek I’ve kissed from the beginning.
You don’t have to like me.

You just have to let me
keep your body yours. It’s mine.

When I was your age I went to a banquet
and a man in a tux pinched my cheeks.

When I was your age I went to a barroom
and a man in a band shirt pinched my ass.

There is so much I don’t know about you.
Last night I skipped a banquet

so I could stay home and do your laundry
and drink wine from my grandmother’s glass.

When I was your age boys traded quarters
for a claw at my carcass on a pleather bench

while I missed the first few seconds of a song
I’d hoped to record on my backseat boombox.

When I was your age I enjoyed a hook.
You think I know nothing of metamorphosis

but when I was your age I invented a key change.
You don’t have to know what I know.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/147130/twelve
Before the Rain by Lianne Spidel,Lianne Spidel,"In 'Before the Rain', Lianne Spidel begins with the poet explaining how she always wakes up just before it begins to rain. She believes that in a past life she was once 'some tribal warrior' or 'a Loyalist hiding in the woods', hiding their child from sight. She imagines that the cover of rainfall would be the perfect weather to stop them from being heard as they ran away, with the footsteps becoming lost in the downpour. Spidel connects with this far away identity, seeing herself as a descendant of this historic woman. They both listen for the rain, still in the darkness while waiting for the first signs of its coming. As the rain arrives, Spidel can finally see how the woman escapes, a sense of joy flooding from present to past.","Minutes before the rain begins
I always waken, listening
to the world hold its breath,
as if a phone had rung once in a far
room or a door had creaked
in the darkness.

Perhaps the genes of some forebear
startle in me, some tribal warrior
keeping watch on a crag beside a loch,
miserable in the cold,

though I think it is a woman's waiting
I have come to know,
a Loyalist hiding in the woods,
muffling the coughing of her child
against her linen skirts, her dark head
bent over his, her fear spent
somewhere else in time,

leaving only this waiting,

and I hope she escaped
with her child, and I suppose she did.
If not, I wouldn't be lying here awake,
alive, listening for the rain to begin
so that she can run, the sound
of her footsteps lost, the sight
of them blotted away on the path.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/40562/before-the-rain
In the Seventh Year by Jackie Kay,Jackie Kay,'In the Seventh Year' by Jackie Kay is a nature and emotion-focused poem that describes a relationship in its seventh year. The poem uses an extended metaphor to describe the ever-changing nature of the speaker's relationship. The relationship is described as turbulent in one moment and beautiful and calm in the next. It is something that brings the speaker a great deal of pain and joy. It is “timeless” and “changing.” This suggests the speaker believes that the relationship is going to continue to change in the future. This isn't something she's dreading but something that she has embraced. You can listen to the full poem here.,"Our sea is still mysterious as morning mist

its flapping arms stretched out for dry sand

its running heels sliding over pebbles

when the sun dives in at night

We are turquoise and clear some days

still as a breeze; others story like stones

my love an ache, the early light

spreading the water

over and over

clasping this timeless, this changing thing.",https://africmglinchey.wordpress.com/2021/11/14/in-the-seventh-year-by-jackie-kay/
Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!] by Frank O’Hara,Frank O’Hara,"'Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!]' by Frank O'Hara depicts a few moments in a speaker's life as he walks in New York and learns that Lana Turner has collapsed. The poem takes the reader through simple details that depict the landscape of New York, the speaker's state of mind, and his surprise at learning that Lana has collapsed. He's with a companion of some sort, to whom this poem is addressed, but doesn't pay too much attention to this person. Instead, he's more interested in the weather, comparing New York to California, and the world of Lana Turner.","Lana Turner has collapsed!
I was trotting along and suddenly
it started raining and snowing
and you said it was hailing
but hailing hits you on the head
hard so it was really snowing and
raining and I was in such a hurry
to meet you but the traffic
was acting exactly like the sky
and suddenly I see a headline
lana turner has collapsed!
there is no snow in Hollywood
there is no rain in California
I have been to lots of parties
and acted perfectly disgraceful
but I never actually collapsed
oh Lana Turner we love you get up",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57556/poem-lana-turner-has-collapsed
"Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art by John Keats",John Keats,"'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art' by John Keats contains a speaker's desire to remain in the company of his lover forever. 'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art' by John Keats begins with the speaker stating that he wants to be “stedfast” like a star. John Keats envies its sure and stable position from which it can see the earth in all its glory. From this description of the poem he moves then to the image of him, nestled in bed against the breast of his 'fair love'. The implication is clearly that he would like to preserve this moment forever, just as the star remains fixed in its eternal spot. Moreover, the poet immediately goes back on the first statement and gives the reader several reasons why he does not want this. The most important of these is that the stars are alone. They do not have anything to occupy their minds besides the troubles of humans down below nor do they have true companions. Hence they are alone and cold in the dark. As the poem continues, the speaker describes how he wants to take on a star's steadfast position so that he might stay with his lover. He is happiest with his head “Pillow'd” on her breast and intends to live there in his emotions for the rest of time.","Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44468/bright-star-would-i-were-stedfast-as-thou-art
Lovesong by Ted Hughes,Ted Hughes,"Lovesong' by Ted Hughes describes a relationship that exists between an unnamed man and woman who are deep in the joys and pains of love. The poem begins with the speaker stating that the two are doing everything they can to “keep” one another past the natural ending of this moment and their greater love affair. They both know that the emotions they are experiencing are limited. At some point, the moment is going to end and they are going to have to go back to the real world. In the next section, the speaker describes the highs and lows of their “moment.” They feel an unlimited passion for one another. Sometimes though it is tinted by anger, false promises, and feelings of revenge. These equally passionate emotions define their relationship as much as the positive ones do. ","He loved her and she loved him.
His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to
He had no other appetite
She bit him she gnawed him she sucked
She wanted him complete inside her
Safe and sure forever and ever
Their little cries fluttered into the curtains

Her eyes wanted nothing to get away
Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows
He gripped her hard so that life
Should not drag her from that moment
He wanted all future to cease
He wanted to topple with his arms round her
Off that moment's brink and into nothing
Or everlasting or whatever there was

Her embrace was an immense press
To print him into her bones
His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace
Where the real world would never come
Her smiles were spider bites
So he would lie still till she felt hungry
His words were occupying armies
Her laughs were an assassin's attempts
His looks were bullets daggers of revenge
His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets
His whispers were whips and jackboots
Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing
His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway
Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks
And their deep cries crawled over the floors
Like an animal dragging a great trap
His promises were the surgeon's gag
Her promises took the top off his skull
She would get a brooch made of it
His vows pulled out all her sinews
He showed her how to make a love-knot
Her vows put his eyes in formalin
At the back of her secret drawer
Their screams stuck in the wall

Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves
Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop

In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs
In their dreams their brains took each other hostage

In the morning they wore each other's face",https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495361-Lovesong-by-Ted-Hughes
Cynthia by Morton Schmidt (22 Jump Street),Undefined Poet,"'Cynthia' is an amusing and unusual slam poem performed by Jonah Hill's character in 22 Jump Street. The poem begins with Jonah Hill saying whatever comes to mind and attempting to find a subject to speak about. First, his character states that he feels angry about Cynthia's death.

Warm Summer Sun by Mark Twain,Mark Twain,"
‘Warm Summer Sun’ by Mark Twain is a poem that expresses the process of aging and life, all the way to life’s final moments. The wording involved in this representation of life shows that the journey does come with hardships, but it is a beautiful concept. The quickness of the poem mimics, as well, the rapid speed that life can take, so underneath the wonder expressed regarding life, there is also the caution to hold to it fully since it can prove fleeting. From beginning to end, though, the beauty of life remains a grounding theme to this poem.","Warm summer sun,
Shine kindly here,
Warm southern wind,
Blow softly here.

Lie light, lie light.
Good night, dear heart,

the ISM by Wanda Coleman,Wanda Coleman,"'the ISM' by Wanda Coleman describes how several modern concepts influence a human mind and how the poetic persona is molded by them. This poem revolves around the influence of the “-isms” on Coleman's mind. The speaker, who is the poet herself, expresses how concepts like racism, capitalism, and others influence her mind. The reflection of the ideas is everywhere. In the air, the people living around the speaker, music, supermarket aisles, television, streets, even in the flashing street lights, a person can find the reflection of those things. Thus, it influences the mind and shapes it according to the idea that is accepted by the majority.","tired i count the ways in which it determines my life
permeates everything. it's in the air
lives next door to me in stares of neighbors
meets me each day in the office. its music comes out the radio
drives beside me in my car. strolls along with me
down supermarket aisles
it's on television
and in the streets even when my walk is casual/undefined
it's overhead flashing lights

when i would speak of other things",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/154091/the-ism
Eel Tail by Alice Oswald,Alice Oswald,"'Eel Tail' by Alice Oswald is a pictorial poem that describes the eels and their movements in the water. The poem invokes the audience to notice eels that hide in low tide. They are described using three metaphors, namely “preliminary,” “pre-world creatures,” and “cousins of the moon.” Then the speaker goes on to talk about their looks and their shyness in human presence. While they make their way into their hiding, the observer could only hear muted “hissed interruptions” and the sound of the wind. When the wind cleared, they could find the creature again silently floating in the water. Once again, if one makes a slight movement, they dive back into their hiding.","sometimes you see mudfish, those short lead lengths of eels that hide at low tide those roping and wagging, preliminary, pre-world creatures, cousins of the moon, who love blackness, aloofness, always move under cover of the unmoon and then as soon as you see them gone untranslatable hissed interruptions unspeakable wide chapped lips it’s the wind again cursing the water and when it clears you keep looking and looking for those underlurkers, uncontrolled little eddies, when you lever their rooves up they lie limbless hairless like the bends of some huge plumbing system sucking and sucking the marshes and sometimes its just a smirk of ripples and then as soon as you see them gone untranslatable hissed interruptions unspeakable wide chapped lips it’s the wind again bothering the reeds and when it clears you keep looking and looking for those backlashes waterwicks you keep finding those sea-veins still flowing, little cables of shadow, vanishing dream-lines long roots of the penumbra but they just drill down into gravel and dwindle as quick as drips and then as soon as you see them gone untranslatable hissed interruptions unspeakable wide chapped lips it’s the wind again pushing on your ears and when it clears sometimes you see that whip-thin tail of a waning moon start burrowing back into blackness and then as soon as you see her and then as soon as you say so gone",chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://papers.xtremepape.rs/CAIE/IGCSE/English%20%E2%80%93%20Literature%20(US)%20(0427)/0427_s19_qp_1.pdf
Bag of Mice by Nick Flynn,Nick Flynn,"'Bag of Mice' by Nick Flynn is a memorable poem that conveys the elements of a dream and loss the speaker suffered. The first line tells the reader that they're about to hear about a dream. In this dream, the speaker came upon someone's suicide note. This belonged to someone they cared deeply about. When they opened it, the bag caught fire, and the mice inside it ran out into the field. The bag burnt, and the letters disappeared along with it. As they burnt, the writer's voice was released into the air like a song, and the mice grew “wilder.”","I dreamt your suicide note
was scrawled in pencil on a brown paperbag,
& in the bag were six baby mice. The bag
opened into darkness,
smoldering
from the top down. The mice,
huddled at the bottom, scurried the bag
across a shorn field. I stood over it
& as the burning reached each carbon letter
of what you'd written
your voice released into the night
like a song, & the mice
grew wilder",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/bag-mice
On Monsieur’s Departure by Queen Elizabeth I,Queen Elizabeth I,"'On Monsieur's Departure' by Queen Elizabeth I describes the emotional tumult a speaker experiences after separating from the one she loves. The poem begins with the speaker describing how she is grieving but is unable to show it. She is restricted by her position, whether that be as Queen of England, as the poet was, or as a woman, from showing her true emotions. She is always two things at once: talkative and mute, cold and hot, in love and full of hate. The speaker has an inner self she is unable to acknowledge. In the second stanza she mourns the fact that even though this person is gone, she is unable to stop feeling for him. She can't get a hold of the cares in her life enough so that she may control them. They run from her, and continuously haunt her as she tries to find some peace. In the final stanza, she asks that she no longer be kept in this liminal place between love and hate. She wishes that her lover either scorn her, or act gentler towards her as her current state of being is untenable. By the end, she has come to the conclusion that there is no way her for to rid herself of her cares. They will stay with her until her death.","I grieve and dare not show my discontent,
I love and yet am forced to seem to hate,
I do, yet dare not say I ever meant,
I seem stark mute but inwardly do prate.
I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned,
Since from myself another self I turned.

My care is like my shadow in the sun,
Follows me flying, flies when I pursue it,
Stands and lies by me, doth what I have done.
His too familiar care doth make me rue it.
No means I find to rid him from my breast,
Till by the end of things it be supprest.

Some gentler passion slide into my mind,
For I am soft and made of melting snow;
Or be more cruel, love, and so be kind.
Let me or float or sink, be high or low.
Or let me live with some more sweet content,
Or die and so forget what love ere meant.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44221/on-monsieurs-departure
On a Certain Lady at Court by Alexander Pope,Alexander Pope,"In 'On a Certain Lady at Court,' Alexander Pope satirizes a woman who doesn't love him back. In this poem, Pope's speaker spends his time talking about her and praising her reason, wit, and beauty. Yet, she is just a friend and nothing more. The speaker seems smitten by the woman's neglect as he describes her as a beautiful (handsome), humble and sensible person. Everyone in the court can testify to her beauty and nature, yet she does not see it in herself as if she is blind to “Pride” and “Folly.” The tone of the poem is ironic and pointed as the speaker desperately wants her attention and for her to realize her worth.","I KNOW a thing that 's most uncommon;
(Envy, be silent and attend!)
I know a reasonable woman,
Handsome and witty, yet a friend.
Not warp'd by passion, awed by rumour;
Not grave through pride, nor gay through folly;
An equal mixture of good-humour
And sensible soft melancholy.
'Has she no faults then (Envy says), Sir?'
Yes, she has one, I must aver:
When all the world conspires to praise her,
The woman's deaf, and does not hear.",https://englishverse.com/poems/on_a_certain_lady_at_court
A Subaltern’s Love Song by John Betjeman,John Betjeman,"'A Subaltern's Love Song' by John Betjeman is a humorous, upbeat poem that tells of the real-life love the poet had for Miss Joan Hunter Dunn. The poem begins with the speaker exclaiming over how much he cares for Dunn, and the joy he gets from playing tennis with her. She always wins, and while this sometimes makes him sad, it more than often makes him “glad.” She wins skillfully and “gaily.” After playing tennis on this particular day, the two go around the house and have drinks while watching the news. They are staying in a large house which is clearly owned by Dunn's family. After this, they get ready to go out. They're going to a dance at a Golf Club, and are getting into their best clothes. The speaker struggles with his tie, and then describes the surroundings of the house. There are a number of trophies in Dunn's room, and clothes on the floor. He ends up waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs and they drive together to the club. The speaker is very excited by the prospect of the evening, but even more so by the fact that he is with Dunn. Rather than go inside though, it appears that the two stay in the car talking. This leads to the last line, announcing that they got engaged.","Miss J.Hunter Dunn, Miss J.Hunter Dunn,
Furnish'd and burnish'd by Aldershot sun,
What strenuous singles we played after tea,
We in the tournament - you against me!

Love-thirty, love-forty, oh! weakness of joy,
The speed of a swallow, the grace of a boy,
With carefullest carelessness, gaily you won,
I am weak from your loveliness, Joan Hunter Dunn

Miss Joan Hunter Dunn, Miss Joan Hunter Dunn,
How mad I am, sad I am, glad that you won,
The warm-handled racket is back in its press,
But my shock-headed victor, she loves me no less.

Her father's euonymus shines as we walk,
And swing past the summer-house, buried in talk,
And cool the verandah that welcomes us in
To the six-o'clock news and a lime-juice and gin.

The scent of the conifers, sound of the bath,
The view from my bedroom of moss-dappled path,
As I struggle with double-end evening tie,
For we dance at the Golf Club, my victor and I.

On the floor of her bedroom lie blazer and shorts,
And the cream-coloured walls are be-trophied with sports,
And westering, questioning settles the sun,
On your low-leaded window, Miss Joan Hunter Dunn.

The Hillman is waiting, the light's in the hall,
The pictures of Egypt are bright on the wall,
My sweet, I am standing beside the oak stair
And there on the landing's the light on your hair.

By roads ""not adopted"", by woodlanded ways,
She drove to the club in the late summer haze,
Into nine-o'clock Camberley, heavy with bells
And mushroomy, pine-woody, evergreen smells.

Miss Joan Hunter Dunn, Miss Joan Hunter Dunn,
I can hear from the car park the dance has begun,
Oh! Surrey twilight! importunate band!
Oh! strongly adorable tennis-girl's hand!

Around us are Rovers and Austins afar,
Above us the intimate roof of the car,
And here on my right is the girl of my choice,
With the tilt of her nose and the chime of her voice.

And the scent of her wrap, and the words never said,
And the ominous, ominous dancing ahead.
We sat in the car park till twenty to one
And now I'm engaged to Miss Joan Hunter Dunn.",https://allpoetry.com/A-Subaltern's-Love-Song
The Weakness by Toi Derricotte,Toi Derricotte,"'The Weakness' by Toi Derricotte describes an old woman and her granddaughter's hesitations in public due to their skin color. The speaker of this poem shares her childhood experience of going to the Saks departmental store. She hesitates to share the details except for her grandmother's reaction on that day. Her grandmother dragged her through the perfume aisles and repeatedly told her to get up in utter humiliation. The speaker could not disobey her order, yet she clung to her problems. Then, she was dressed into tight leggings and dragged away from the store. What her grandmother felt on that day is described in this poem.","That time my grandmother dragged me
through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up
by my arm, hissing, “Stand up,”
through clenched teeth, her eyes
bright as a dog’s
cornered in the light.
She said it over and over,
as if she were Jesus,
and I were dead. She had been
solid as a tree,
a fur around her neck, a
light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling
marble and passed through
brass openings—in 1945.
There was not even a black
elevator operator at Saks.
The saleswoman had brought velvet
leggings to lace me in, and cooed,
as if in the service of all grandmothers.
My grandmother had smiled, but not
hungrily, not like my mother
who hated them, but wanted to please,
and they had smiled back, as if
they were wearing wooden collars.
When my legs gave out, my grandmother
dragged me up and held me like God
holds saints by the
roots of the hair. I begged her
to believe I couldn’t help it. Stumbling,
her face white
with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing
away from those eyes
that saw through
her clothes, under
her skin, all the way down
to the transparent
genes confessing.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/42875/the-weakness
A Question by Robert Frost,Robert Frost,"A Question Analysis A voice said, Look me in the stars And tell me truly, men of earth, If all the soul-and-body scars Were not too much to pay for birth. No need to do a verse-by-verse analysis of 'A Question' — this is the entire poem. And despite its small size, it says a lot. At its face value, the poem can be read and understood fairly easily. How might one weigh the tragedies of life against its potential and its opportunities? If the human soul originates in a place where there is no pain — God, Heaven, or whatever it is you believe in, if you do believe in those concepts — then how can the silence of nonexistence compare to the pains of life? It's a highly philosophical and very abstract question. Who the voice in the stars in is unidentified; were the “m” in “me” capitalized, we could safely assume the voice is God, but it seems likely this is intentionally kept ambiguous. Still, to assume it is God or a God-like figure would make sense as a concept, but the point of the poem is, as the title suggests, the question itself. Are all the soul-and-body scars too much to pay for the life that deals them? And, in a much darker image, what if the answer to the question is “no?” As a commentary on life, we can see the narrator wondering to themselves what it is they get from living that makes it worth the pain, and the fact that the poem ends there indicates what a difficult question it is to answer. The poem also suggests that this suffering is destiny — discussing pain as an “entry fee” for living suggests that no matter who you are or where you're born, it is likely that you will find yourself questioning whether living is quite worth the pain associated. On the other hand, this makes perfect sense as an analysis — everyone experiences pain at some point or the other. Personal loss, grief, tragedy; in a sense, these are destiny, and that seems to be what this poem is getting at. And in those moments of suffering, we have to be able to remember the best parts of our life and remember that there is light that makes our lives worth living, and that makes our suffering worth enduring.","A voice said, Look me in the stars
And tell me truly, men of earth,

Night by Anne Brontë,Anne Brontë,"The course of Night follows the speaker contemplating the power of nighttime in contrast to the day. The narrator — presumably Anne Brontë herself — expresses a very specific emotion that the nighttime brings out. It is a strange combination of solitude, loneliness, and comfort, coupled with what appears to be heartsickness. It is a complicated poem, for all its simplicity, because of how intensely it examines the emotion.","I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,

In the first stanza of the poem, the speaker introduces a man named “anyone” who lived in an ordinary town filled with the chiming of bells. He moved through life honestly, always aware of everything he'd left undone, and happy to celebrate the things he had accomplished. Despite his seemingly good nature, noone in the two “both little and small” cared for “anyone” at all. They cared only for themselves and continued to plant and harvest in that way. The speaker goes on to introduce “noone” a woman who lived in the same area and loved anyone. The relationship was at first interesting for the children, but they soon forgot about it despite the growing love noone had for anyone. Noone was well aware of everything anyone was feeling. Anyone eventually died as did noone. The townspeople who'd been concerned with their own lives, took the time to bury them next to one another. The poem concludes with an emphasis on the cyclical nature of life and the birth of the next generation of townspeople.","anyone lived in a pretty how town

Women and men(both little and small)

Waiting by John Burroughs,John Burroughs,"'Waiting' by John Burroughs is a powerful poem that asserts a speaker's opinion about fate. The poem begins with the speaker declaring that he's no longer going to fight his fate. He's going to sit back and wait for it to come to him. He knows, as he repeats throughout the entire poem, that there is nothing he can do to change the future. He should just accept it and know that good things are coming. He's lived a good life, he implies, and will therefore be rewarded.","SERENE, I fold my hands and wait,
Nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea;
I rave no more 'gainst time or fate,
For, lo! my own shall come to me.
 
I stay my haste, I make delays,
For what avails this eager pace?
I stand amid the eternal ways,
And what is mine shall know my face.
 
Asleep, awake, by night or day,
The friends I seek are seeking me;
No wind can drive my bark astray,
Nor change the tide of destiny.
 
What matter if I stand alone?
I wait with joy the coming years;
My heart shall reap where it hath sown,
And garner up its fruit of tears.
 
The waters know their own and draw
The brook that springs in yonder height;
So flows the good with equal law
Unto the soul of pure delight.
 
The stars come nightly to the sky;
The tidal wave unto the sea;
Nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high,
Can keep my own away from me.",http://www.poetry-archive.com/b/waiting.html
Sneezles by A.A. Milne,Alan Alexander Milne,"'Sneezles' by A.A. Milne tells of the complicated, nonsense illness contracted by the famous character from children's literature, Christopher Robin. The poem begins with the speaker telling of Christopher's illness and how his parents put him to bed. He was suffering from what sounds like a cold but his parents get very upset, imagining that it was something worse. They consult with a number of doctors who make the situation out to be even more complicated and nonsensical than it already is. By the end of the poem, it is clear that Christopher is all better and is planning the next thing he's going to do to “amuse” his parents.","Christopher Robin
Had wheezles
And sneezles,
They bundled him
Into
His bed.
They gave him what goes
With a cold in the nose,
And some more for a cold
In the head.
They wondered
If wheezles
Could turn
Into measles,
If sneezles
Would turn
Into mumps;
They examined his chest
For a rash,
And the rest
Of his body for swellings and lumps.
They sent for some doctors
In sneezles
And wheezles
To tell them what ought
To be done.
All sorts and conditions
Of famous physicians
Came hurrying round
At a run.
They all made a note
Of the state of his throat,
They asked if he suffered from thirst;
They asked if the sneezles
Came after the wheezles,
Or if the first sneezle
Came first.
They said, ""If you teazle
A sneezle
Or wheezle,
A measle
May easily grow.
But humour or pleazle
The wheezle
Or sneezle,
The measle
Will certainly go.""
They expounded the reazles
For sneezles
And wheezles,
The manner of measles
When new.
They said ""If he freezles
In draughts and in breezles,
Then PHTHEEZLES
May even ensue.""


Christopher Robin
Got up in the morning,
The sneezles had vanished away.
And the look in his eye
Seemed to say to the sky,
""Now, how to amuse them to-day?""",https://allpoetry.com/Sneezles
You Cannot Do This by Gwendolyn MacEwen,Gwendolyn MacEwen,"'You Cannot Do This' by Gwendolyn MacEwen is a short poem that speaks about a group of people who are being mistreated. The poem begins with the speaker using the phrase “You cannot do this to them, these are my people”. It appears again at the end of the poem, bookmarking the verses. She tells the reader and her intended listener that what she is talking about is not “poetry” or “art”. It is not made entirely clear who she is speaking about, but it is likely the people who make art and poetry. She does not want her people mistreated. Their “horizons,” representing hope and the future, are not going to be hacked away on her watch. She plans to chronicle whatever happens to them, just as their graves will. In the last stanza, she tries to make sense of what, presumably writing and art are for “[her] people”. They are vices similar to the desire to win trophies and be around horses. They are related to food and music, as well as dancing and power. Her people are more like scientists than artists.","You cannot do this to them, these are my people;
I am not speaking of poetry, I am not speaking of art.
you cannot do this to them, these are my people.
you cannot hack away the horizon in front of their eyes.

the tomb, articulate, will record your doing;
I will record it also, this is not art.
this is a kind of science, a kind of hobby,
a kind of personal vice like coin collecting.

it has something to do with horses
and signet rings and school trophies;
it has something to do with the pride of the lions;
it has something to do with good food and music,
and something to do with power and dancing.

The Hippopotamus by Hilaire Belloc,Hilaire Belloc,"'The Hippopotamus' by Hilaire Belloc is a short and humorous poem about shooting a hippopotamus with expensive bullets. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker begins by stating that there are times when they need to shoot a hippopotamus. This is a surprising line that is supposed to inspire the reader to continue through the next three lines to find out what situations the speaker finds themselves in. Rather than illuminating the kind of life they lead further, the speaker says that they have to use “platinum” bullets because “lead” ones are only going to flatten on the animal's hide. This is an example of a hyperbolic statement that's created in order to make the poem more humorous.","I shoot the Hippopotamus
With bullets made of platinum,
Because if I use leaden ones
His hide is sure to flatten 'em.",https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-hippopotamus-5/
To My Dear and Loving Husband by Anne Bradstreet,Anne Bradstreet,"'To My Dear and Loving Husband' by Anne Bradstreet is a beautiful poem praising the mutual love between the poet and her beloved husband. 'To My Dear and Loving Husband' by Anne Bradstreet is a love poem. It talks about the sweet relationship between the poet and her husband. Through this poem, the poet glorifies her loving husband. She feels like they are no different. They are one. There are no such materialistic things that can be compared with their feelings for one another. The poet has a thirst for the love of his husband and his heart has the thing the poet longs for. In fact, by writing this verse Anne Bradstreet wants to immortalize her love for her husband. As poetry is something that outlives men, their love will remain forever in these lines of the poem. 'One day I wrote her name upon the strand' by Edmund Spenser also says the same thing at its end.","If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more, we may live ever.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43706/to-my-dear-and-loving-husband
No Problem by Benjamin Zephaniah,Benjamin Zephaniah,"No Problem' by Benjamin Zephaniah is a poem describing how the poet faced racial discrimination in his early life. 'No Problem' by Benjamin Zephaniah says that the poet is not a problem in a white-dominated society. It's their problem that they can't accept the poet as he is. His color isn't the actual problem, it's the mindset that sees the only color. That divides humans according to their speaking style, origin, and bodily characteristics. The poet goes beyond such discriminatory thoughts and welcomes an air of individual freedom in his poem. He proclaims himself as a “versatile” person who wanted to teach the things he knew. But, “they” rejected the overall person for his 'black” identity. The poet doesn't mind it and shows his love for the country without any disgrace to her. He doesn't even hate white men. That's why some of the “best friends” of the poet “are white”. ","I am not de problem
But I bare de brunt
Of silly playground taunts
An racist stunts,
I am not de problem
I am a born academic
But dey got me on de run
Now I am branded athletic,
I am not de problem
If yu give I a chance
I can teach yu of Timbuktu
I can do more dan dance,
I am not de problem
I greet yu wid a smile
Yu put me in a pigeon hole
But I a versatile.
These conditions may affect me
As I get older,
An I am positively sure
I have no chips on me shoulders,
Black is not de problem
Mother country get it right,
An just for de record,
Sum of me best friends are white",https://www.stlukes.swindon.sch.uk/downloads/stLukes/No-Problem-poem-Y9.pdf
Daybreak by Jack London,Jack London,"Daybreak' by Jack London describes an interaction between a speaker and the woman he loves at daybreak. The poem begins with the speaker describing the idyllic scene which is created by the rising of the sun. Everything appears pristine and peaceful. He is standing underneath the window of a house in which the woman he loves is sleeping. In order to wake her, he throws a number of pebbles at her window. He imagines her waking up, bewildered. Eventually, the woman comes to the window, and the whole mood of the poem changes. She apologizes for not having set out the milk cans the night before. She concludes the interaction by asking him to leave “two quarts.”","The blushing dawn the easy illumes,
The birds their merry matins sing,
The buds breath forth their sweet perfumes,
And butterflies are on the wing.
I pause beneath the window high,
The door is locked, the house is quiet;
'Tis there, abed, she sure must lie, -
To Wake her, - ah! I'll try it.
And pebbles hurtling through the air,
Strike full upon the window-pane,
Awakening her who slumbers there
With their insistent hurricane.
Ye gods! in my imagination,
The wondrous scene do I behold -
A nymph's bewildered consternation
At summons thus so fierce and bold.
A moment passes, then I see
The gauzy curtains drawn aside,
And sweet eyes beaming down on me,
And then a window upward glide.
Fair as the morn, with rosy light,
She blushes with a faint surprise,
Then thinking of the previous night,
In dulcet tones she softly cries:
""It should have been put out by Nan,
But I'll be down within a minute -
No, never mind, leave your own can,
And put two quarts, please, in it.""",https://americanliterature.com/author/jack-london/poem/daybreak
Thanatopsis by William Cullen Bryant,William Cullen Bryant,"'Thanatopsis' by William Cullen Bryant speaks on the nature of death and how one should accept the inevitability of its coming and therefore live peacefully. Throughout the lines of this fairly long poem, Bryant speaker talks directly to a listener who has professed fear of dying. He spends time describing the long history of death and the many wise and important men and women who already reside there. You, the speaker says, will rest alongside them at peace with the world. The earth, which once nurtured you, will reclaim your body. The speaker explains how the world of the dead vastly outnumbers the world of the living and that it is better to live accepting death rather than fighting against it. This is the only way to enter into death well.","To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language; for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty, and she glides Into his darker musings, with a mild And healing sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;— Go forth, under the open sky, and list To Nature’s teachings, while from all around—
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—
Comes a still voice—
Yet a few days, and thee The all-beholding sun shall see no more In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground, Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix for ever with the elements, To be a brother to the insensible rock And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould. Yet not to thine eternal resting-place Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings, The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woods—rivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green; and, poured round all, Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,— Are but the solemn decorations all Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, Are shining on the sad abodes of death, Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness, Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound, Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there: And millions in those solitudes, since first The flight of years began, have laid them down In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw In silence from the living, and no friend Take note of thy departure? All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one as before will chase His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train Of ages glide away, the sons of men, The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron and maid, The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man— Shall one by one be gathered to thy side, By those, who in their turn shall follow them. So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan, which moves To that mysterious realm, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/50465/thanatopsis
Harlem Shadows by Claude McKay,Claude McKay,"'Harlem Shadows' by Claude McKay is a powerful poem that depicts sex workers in Harlem during the 1920s. In the first stanza of 'Harlem Shadows,' the speaker begins by describing, using a first-person perspective, the sounds of a woman's footsteps. She's called “a lass” and described as moving through the “Negro Harlem.” It's dark out, and the speaker can also see other women walking. They're prostitutes, headed to “barter at desire's call.” The women work all night, without a chance to rest their feet. The poet paints a dark picture of this occupation and a sympathetic one of the women who are having to make money this way. The poet also makes it clear that these are Black women he's talking about. They are contrasted with the snowflakes and “earth's white breast.” The poem concludes when the speaker addresses the world and his “poor heart.” He describes how poverty and sorrow have been forced onto the feet of his race.","I hear the halting footsteps of a lass
In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall
Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass
To bend and barter at desire's call.
Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet
Go prowling through the night from street to street!

Through the long night until the silver break
Of day the little gray feet know no rest;
Through the lone night until the last snow-flake
Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast,
The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet
Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.

Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way
Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,
Has pushed the timid little feet of clay,
The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!
Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet
In Harlem wandering from street to street.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44693/harlem-shadows
On Finding a Small Fly Crushed in a Book by Charles Tennyson Turner,Charles Tennyson Turner,"'On Finding a Small Fly Crushed in a Book' by Charles Tennyson Turner is a straightforward poem that compares a fly's death to human death. In the first lines of the poem, the speaker talks to a deceased fly that he's found crushed in a book. He interprets its death as accidental, as though someone closed the book on it without meaning to. Despite this, he marvels over the fly's wings and the imprint it left of its life. As the poem progresses, he turns to talk about human life and death and how everyone is going to get crushed in the book of death eventually. But, unlike the fly, humanity won't leave behind something as beautiful as the shimmer of the fly's wings on the book pages.","Some hand, that never meant to do thee hurt,
Has crush'd thee here between these pages pent;
But thou hast left thine own fair monument,
Thy wings gleam out and tell me what thou wert:
Oh! that the memories, which survive us here,
Where half as lovely as these wings of thine!
Pure relics of a blameless life, that shine
Now thou art gone. Our doom is ever near:
The peril is beside us day by day;
The book will close upon us, it may be,
Just as we lift ourselves to soar away
Upon the summer-airs. But, unlike thee,
The closing book may stop our vital breath,
Yet leave no lustre on our page of death.",https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/finding-small-fly-crushed-book
Snake by D.H. Lawrence,D.H. Lawrence,"'Snake' by D.H. Lawrence describes a speaker's various interactions with a snake that came to drink at his water-trough. The poem begins with the speaker describing coming upon the snake in his pyjamas. He was unprepared to see it but immediately happy it was there. Although pleased to see the animal, and more than willing to wait his turn, his inner voice was talking to him. The “voice of his education” was telling him to kill the snake—that he was only refraining from doing so because he was a coward. The speaker admits that he was frightened of the snake, but did not want to drive it away. He liked looking at it and felt honored that it had come to him. Finally, the snake stopped drinking and wriggled through a hole in the wall. The speaker didn't like to watch this happen and threw a log at the wall. This only causes the snake to disappear faster and makes the speaker feel regret for his petty action. This is something he says he has to atone for at the end of 'Snake.' Although Snake is quoted in full below, you can also read the poem at here.","A snake came to my water-trough
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
To drink there.
In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
I came down the steps with my pitcher
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
before me.
He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over
the edge of the stone trough
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
He sipped with his straight mouth,
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
Silently.
Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second-comer, waiting.
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused
a moment,
And stooped and drank a little more,
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels
of the earth
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.
The voice of my education said to me
He must be killed,
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold
are venomous.
And voices in me said, If you were a man
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.
But must I confess how I liked him,
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink
at my water-trough
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
Into the burning bowels of this earth?
Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
I felt so honoured.
And yet those voices:
If you were not afraid, you would kill him!
And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
But even so, honoured still more
That he should seek my hospitality
From out the dark door of the secret earth.
He drank enough
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
Seeming to lick his lips,
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
And slowly turned his head,
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,
and entered farther,
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into
that horrid black hole,
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing
himself after,
Overcame me now his back was turned.
I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
I picked up a clumsy log
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
I think it did not hit him,
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed
in an undignified haste,
Writhed like lightning, and was gone
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.
And immediately I regretted it.
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.
And I thought of the albatross,
And I wished he would come back, my snake.
For he seemed to me again like a king,
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
Now due to be crowned again.
And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
Of life.
And I have something to expiate:
A pettiness.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/148471/snake-5bec57d7bfa17
An Unknown Girl by Moniza Alvi,Moniza Alvi,"'An Unknown Girl' by Moniza Alvi speaks on an intense connection between an “unknown girl,” a bazaar, and Indian culture. The poem begins with the speaker sitting in a marketplace getting a henna tattoo from an “unknown girl,” this girl, like the speaker, is never named or described in greater detail. The speaker looks down at the peacock that has been “iced” onto her hand and then around at the shops. She feels a connection to the market stalls and mannequins in the shop windows with their western-style wigs. She wants to remember this moment, hold onto it, and force to it become part of herself. She looks forward in time and sees herself returning home with the henna tattoo, picking off the dark brown lines and watching the light brown markings fade over the next days. She will have a temporary connection to this place for which she will always yearn.","In the evening bazaar
Studded with neon
An unknown girl
Is hennaing my hand
She squeezes a wet brown line
Form a nozzle
She is icing my hand,
Which she steadies with her
On her satin peach knee.
In the evening bazaar
For a few rupees
An unknown girl is hennaing my hand
As a little air catches
My shadow stitched kameez
A peacock spreads its lines
Across my palm.
Colours leave the street
Float up in balloons.
Dummies in shop-fronts
Tilt and stare
With their western perms.
Banners for Miss India 1993
For curtain cloth
And sofa cloth
Canopy me.
I have new brown veins.
In the evening bazaar
Very deftly
An unknown girl
is hennaing my hand
I am clinging
To these firm peacock lines
Like people who cling
to sides of a train.
Now the furious streets
Are hushed.
I’ll scrape off
The dry brown lines
Before I sleep,
Reveal soft as a snail trail
The amber bird beneath.
It will fade in a week.
When India appears and reappears
I’ll lean across a country
With my hands outstretched
Longing for the unknown girl

Why? by Spike Milligan,Spike Milligan,"'Why?' by Spike Milligan is a short humorous poem that speaks on American and Chinese detectives and their hat-wearing habits. In the first lines, the speaker tells the reader, very simply, that American detectives never take off their hats while investigating murders. He goes on in the second stanza, adding a postscript, to say that the Chinese “Tecs” are the opposite. They're more “dreaded” and always investigate “bare-headed”.","American Detectives
Never remove their hats
When investigating murders
In other people's flats.

P.S. Chinese Tecs
Are far more dreaded!
And they always appear

Rising Five by Norman Nicholson,Norman Nicholson,"'Rising Five' by Norman Nicholson describes how one's perspective on life and time changes from birth, to childhood, adulthood, and to old age. The poem begins with the speaker reflecting on the words of his child, or a child in his care. The child claims to be “rising five” rather than four years old. He is looking into the future, towards increased age, as a positive. This is something that scares the speaker and sends him into layers of contemplation about his environment and what it means to live. He looks around him and sees the landscape is gracefully changing. It is no longer winter, but “rising spring.” He broadens his view further, up to the sky, and sees that the sun is setting. The day no longer exists, it is “rising night.” In the final stanza, he reflects on how one considers the process of aging while young, and how that changes with marriage and parenthood. By the end of the poem he sees living not as life but as “rising death.”","I’m rising five” he said
“Not four” and the little coils of hair
Un-clicked themselves upon his head.
His spectacles, brimful of eyes to stare
At me and the meadow, reflected cones of light
Above his toffee-buckled cheeks. He’d been alive
Fifty-six months or perhaps a week more;
_____________Not four
But rising five.

Around him in the field, the cells of spring
Bubbled and doubled; buds unbuttoned; shoot
And stem shook out the creases from their frills,
And every tree was swilled with green.
It was the season after blossoming,
Before the forming of the fruit:
_____Not May
But rising June._____

And in the sky
The dust dissected the tangential light:
_____Not day
But rising night;
_____Not now
But rising soon.

The new buds push the old leaves from the bough.
We drop our youth behind us like a boy
Throwing away his toffee-wrappers. We never see the flower,
But only the fruit in the flower; never the fruit,
But only the rot in the fruit. We look for the marriage bed
In the baby’s cradle; we look for the grave in the bed;
_____Not living
But rising dead.",http://margaret-cooter.blogspot.com/2014/04/poetry-thursday-rising-five-by-norman.html
All Along the Watchtower by Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan,"All Along the Watchtower' by Bob Dylan is a beautiful and complex song that describes a coming conflict between two societal opposites. The song describes in sparse detail the lives of a joker and a thief. They are outside the walls of society and they know it. The former expresses concern over their life and what value there is in what they accomplish. Dylan's thief immediately calms him down and directs this short storyline towards its conclusion. The two riders are arriving at a walled castle of some kind. There, in a suspenseful atmosphere, something is going to happen.","“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl",https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/all-along-watchtower/
The Pains of Sleep by Samuel Taylor Coleridge,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"'The Pains of Sleep' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge describes a period in a speaker's life in which he is besieged by terrible imagery. The poem begins with the speaker stating that he has been lying in his bed for an extended period of time, unable to move. He does the only type of prayer he knows how, and turns his soul over from “reverential resignation” to “Love.” This action should cleanse his restlessness and purify the thoughts he's been having. As the poem continues on the speaker describes what the last two nights of his life have been like. He has seen a variety of terrible images that wake him screaming from sleep. All of these sights represent the horrors that mankind is capable of, and by default, the speaker himself. By the end of the piece, he is asking, almost desperately, why it is that he is the one who has to bear the responsibility of these images.","Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,
It hath not been my use to pray
With moving lips or bended knees;
But silently, by slow degrees,
My spirit I to Love compose,
In humble trust mine eye-lids close,
With reverential resignation
No wish conceived, no thought exprest,
Only a sense of supplication;
A sense o'er all my soul imprest
That I am weak, yet not unblest,
Since in me, round me, every where
Eternal strength and Wisdom are.

But yester-night I prayed aloud
In anguish and in agony,
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me:
A lurid light, a trampling throng,
Sense of intolerable wrong,
And whom I scorned, those only strong!
Thirst of revenge, the powerless will
Still baffled, and yet burning still!
Desire with loathing strangely mixed
On wild or hateful objects fixed.
Fantastic passions! maddening brawl!
And shame and terror over all!
Deeds to be hid which were not hid,
Which all confused I could not know
Whether I suffered, or I did:
For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe,
My own or others still the same
Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.

So two nights passed: the night's dismay
Saddened and stunned the coming day.
Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me
Distemper's worst calamity.
The third night, when my own loud scream
Had waked me from the fiendish dream,
O'ercome with sufferings strange and wild,
I wept as I had been a child;
And having thus by tears subdued
My anguish to a milder mood,
Such punishments, I said, were due
To natures deepliest stained with sin,—
For aye entempesting anew
The unfathomable hell within,
The horror of their deeds to view,
To know and loathe, yet wish and do!
Such griefs with such men well agree,
But wherefore, wherefore fall on me?
To be loved is all I need,
And whom I love, I love indeed.",poetryfoundation.org/poems/43995/the-pains-of-sleep
Mossbawn: Sunlight by Seamus Heaney,Seamus Heaney,"'Mossbawn: Sunlight' by Seamus Heaney is a simple, moving poem that depicts scenes from the poet's youth and the life of his aunt, Mary. In the first lines of 'Mossbawn: Sunlight', the speaker gives a few details about the exterior of his aunt's home. The sun plays an important role, heating the scene. The warmth is continued within the house, emanating from the stove in which Mary Heaney cooks. He remembers how she moved through the kitchen, dusted the rooms, as well as how her love went into everything she did.","There was a sunlit absence.
The helmeted pump in the yard
heated its iron,
water honeyed

in the slung bucket
and the sun stood
like a griddle cooling
against the wall

of each long afternoon.
So, her hands scuffled
over the bakeboard,
the reddening stove

sent its plaque of heat
against her where she stood
in a floury apron
by the window.

Now she dusts the board
with a goose’s wing,
now sits, broad-lapped,
with whitened nails

and measling shins:
here is a space
again, the scone rising
to the tick of two clocks.

And here is love
like a tinsmith’s scoop
sunk past its gleam
in the meal-bin.",https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1995/8422-poetry/
Genetics by Sinéad Morrissey,Sinéad Morrissey,"“Genetics” by Sinéad Morrissey speaks on the composition of one's body and how one is made of their mother, father, and their combined history. The poem begins with the speaker describing how her fingers resemble those of her father and her palms resemble her mother's. This is a fact that is deeply important to the speaker. It is this connection that allows her to feel that she is still a part of a cohesive family. These parts of her hands keep her family together even after they have split up. Her parents are no longer together, there is a lot of physical and emotional distance between them, but she keeps them connected through a “marriage” of fingers and palms. The speaker even goes so far as to create a marriage ceremony of sorts amongst all her fingers and her palms. Through this act, she is hoping to solidity their marital connection and family bonds. The poem concludes with the speaker considering a future child she could have with her partner and the history that will then be in that child's hands. She is ready to embark on this future, even though her own parents were unsuccessful.","My father’s in my fingers, but my mother’s in my palms.
I lift them up and look at them with pleasure –
I know my parents made me by my hands.

They may have been repelled to separate lands,
to separate hemispheres, may sleep with other lovers,
but in me they touch where fingers link to palms.

With nothing left of their togetherness but friends
who quarry for their image by a river,
at least I know their marriage by my hands.
I shape a chapel where a steeple stands.
And when I turn it over,
my father’s by my fingers, my mother’s by my palms

demure before a priest reciting psalms.
My body is their marriage register.
I re-enact their wedding with my hands.

So take me with you, take up the skin’s demands
for mirroring in bodies of the future.
I’ll bequeath my fingers, if you bequeath your palms.
We know our parents make us by our hands.",https://genius.com/Sinead-morrissey-genetics-annotated
The Tiger Who Wore White Gloves by Gwendolyn Brooks,Gwendolyn Brooks,"'The Tiger Who Wore White Gloves' by Gwendolyn Brooks is a memorable poem that tells the story of a tiger who seeks to break the mold his peers put in him. The speaker describes the tiger's desire to set aside his toughness and jazz up his outfit. He wants to wear white gloves just for the pleasure of it. But, as soon as he gets them the other animals react poorly. They make fun of him and shame him until he has to take them off, dejectedly.","There once was a tiger, terrible and tough,
who said “I don’t think tigers are stylish enough.
They put on only orange and stripes of fierce black.
Fine and fancy fashion is what they mostly lack.
Even though they proudly
speak most loudly,
so that the jungle shakes
and every eye awakes—
Even though they slither
hither and thither
in such a wild way
that few may care to stay—
to be tough just isn’t enough.”
These things the tiger said,
And growled and tossed his head,
and rushed to the jungle fair
for something fine to wear.

Then!—what a hoot and yell
upon the jungle fell
The rhinoceros rasped!
The elephant gasped!
“By all that’s sainted!”
said wolf—and fainted.

The crocodile cried.
The lion sighed.
The leopard sneered.
The jaguar jeered.
The antelope shouted.
The panther pouted.
Everyone screamed
“We never dreamed
that ever could be
in history
a tiger who loves
to wear white gloves.
White gloves are for girls
with manners and curls
and dresses and hats and bow-ribbons.
That’s the way it always was
and rightly so, because
it’s nature’s nice decree
that tiger folk should be
not dainty, but daring,
and wisely wearing
what’s fierce as the face,
not whiteness and lace!”

They shamed him and shamed him—
till none could have blamed him,
when at last, with a sigh
and a saddened eye,
and in spite of his love,
he took off each glove,
and agreed this was meant
all to prevail:
each tiger content
with his lashing tail
and satisfied
with his strong striped hide.",https://100.best-poems.net/tiger-who-wore-white-gloves.html
Flare by Mary Oliver,Mary Oliver,"'Flare' by Mary Oliver is a beautiful poem that asks the reader to leave the past behind and live in the more important present. Throughout the twelve parts of 'Flare,' Mary Oliver's speaker, who is likely the poet herself, describes memories and images of the past. These are things which brought sorrow and pleasure. All of them are buried in a graveyard, one that she visited and then never went back to again. This is the proper way to deal with the past, she thinks. But it's not the way her “mother” or “father” did. They experienced sorrow throughout their lives and lived far too much in their lost dreams and regrets. This isn't how the poet, or, she thinks, the reader wants to live. She encourages everyone to seek out beauty in the natural world, embrace it, and allow it to bring one joy when sorrow seems like the easiest emotion to live in. Life is far too short, she concludes, to live in darkness.","1.

Welcome to the silly, comforting poem.

It is not the sunrise,
which is a red rinse,
which is flaring all over the eastern sky;

it is not the rain falling out of the purse of God;

it is not the blue helmet of the sky afterward,

or the trees, or the beetle burrowing into the earth;

it is not the mockingbird who, in his own cadence,
will go on sizzling and clapping
from the branches of the catalpa that are thick with blossoms,
that are billowing and shining,
that are shaking in the wind.

2.

You still recall, sometimes, the old barn on your
great-grandfather's farm, a place you visited once,
and went into, all alone, while the grownups sat and
talked in the house.
It was empty, or almost. Wisps of hay covered the floor,
and some wasps sang at the windows, and maybe there was
a strange fluttering bird high above, disturbed, hoo-ing
a little and staring down from a messy ledge with wild,
binocular eyes.
Mostly, though, it smelled of milk, and the patience of
animals; the give-offs of the body were still in the air,
a vague ammonia, not unpleasant.
Mostly, though, it was restful and secret, the roof high
up and arched, the boards unpainted and plain.
You could have stayed there forever, a small child in a corner,
on the last raft of hay, dazzled by so much space that seemed
empty, but wasn't.
Then--you still remember--you felt the rap of hunger--it was
noon--and you turned from that twilight dream and hurried back
to the house, where the table was set, where an uncle patted you
on the shoulder for welcome, and there was your place at the table.

3.

Nothing lasts.
There is a graveyard where everything I am talking about is,
now.

I stood there once, on the green grass, scattering flowers.

4.

Nothing is so delicate or so finely hinged as the wings
of the green moth
against the lantern
against its heat
against the beak of the crow
in the early morning.

Yet the moth has trim, and feistiness, and not a drop
of self-pity.

Not in this world.

5.

My mother
was the blue wisteria,
my mother
was the mossy stream out behind the house,
my mother, alas, alas,
did not always love her life,
heavier than iron it was
as she carried it in her arms, from room to room,
oh, unforgettable!

I bury her
in a box
in the earth
and turn away.
My father
was a demon of frustrated dreams,
was a breaker of trust,
was a poor, thin boy with bad luck.
He followed God, there being no one else
he could talk to;
he swaggered before God, there being no one else
who would listen.
Listen,
this was his life.
I bury it in the earth.
I sweep the closets.
I leave the house.

6.

I mention them now,
I will not mention them again.

It is not lack of love
nor lack of sorrow.
But the iron thing they carried, I will not carry.

I give them--one, two, three, four--the kiss of courtesy,
of sweet thanks,
of anger, of good luck in the deep earth.
May they sleep well. May they soften.

But I will not give them the kiss of complicity.
I will not give them the responsibility for my life.

7.

Did you know that the ant has a tongue
with which to gather in all that it can
of sweetness?

Did you know that?

8.

The poem is not the world.
It isn't even the first page of the world.

But the poem wants to flower, like a flower.
It knows that much.

It wants to open itself,
like the door of a little temple,
so that you might step inside and be cooled and refreshed,
and less yourself than part of everything.

9.

The voice of the child crying out of the mouth of the
grown woman
is a misery and a disappointment.
The voice of the child howling out of the tall, bearded,
muscular man
is a misery, and a terror.

10.

Therefore, tell me:
what will engage you?
What will open the dark fields of your mind,
like a lover
at first touching?

11.

Anyway,
there was no barn.
No child in the barn.

No uncle no table no kitchen.

Only a long lovely field full of bobolinks.

12.

When loneliness comes stalking, go into the fields, consider
the orderliness of the world. Notice
something you have never noticed before,

like the tambourine sound of the snow-cricket
whose pale green body is no longer than your thumb.

Stare hard at the hummingbird, in the summer rain,
shaking the water-sparks from its wings.

Let grief be your sister, she will whether or no.
Rise up from the stump of sorrow, and be green also,
like the diligent leaves.

A lifetime isn't long enough for the beauty of this world
and the responsibilities of your life.

Scatter your flowers over the graves, and walk away.
Be good-natured and untidy in your exuberance.

In the glare of your mind, be modest.
And beholden to what is tactile, and thrilling.

Live with the beetle, and the wind.

This is the dark bread of the poem.
This is the dark and nourishing bread of the poem.",http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/mary_oliver/poems/15811
